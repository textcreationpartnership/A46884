         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

The holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Iob saith <hi>that Man doth not know its price.</hi> It is most certayne, it must cost flesh, and blood: (as a certayne Author writes) yea the very marrow of the bones. And yet iounge, &amp; vnmortified persons full of flesh, and Blood who haue noe vertue, or practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se austeritie in fastinge, watchinge &amp;c. or euer haue done: will (as wee vse to say) with hose, and shoes enter into this <hi>Kingdome.</hi> But they know not the price of this <hi>kingdome.</hi> For such a puritie is required; that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this booke vsed to saye; that wee were not in this life to take example from men, but from Angells. Finally such puritie that noe greater is in the powre of man; soe that hee must not only doe well, but the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost, and best of all. Wherefore the said Author vsed to say that in case such an one were to dye instantly hee would doe noe otherwise then hee continually, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily doth: sauinge only that which <hi>God,</hi> and the Holy Church commandeth him at such a tyme.</p>

Furthermore some are particularly dedicated vnto <hi>God,</hi> &amp; make profession of a perfect, and spirituall life: or at least wee are Christians: wee see, and behold this puritie of Loue, this soe greate perfection, and in the meane tyme are soe farre from itt.

This booke moreouer must needs be most profitable, since it teacheth all that, which all Spirituall writers ayme at in all their bookes of Meditations, and other Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Exercises. For all Meditations of the Passion, Death, and Iudgement helpe for to make men die to all euill desires; and to exercise themselues in all vertue, &amp; to enkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in them the loue of <hi>God</hi> &amp;c.

For as some bookes teach vs the Exercise of Martha, others of Marie, this ioyneth them both together teaching vs how wee may become both Martha, &amp; Marie together.

Hence wee doe not say that the Iron is vnited with the fyer, as-long as wee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue itt to be Iron; but to be perfectly vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, itt must be soe glowing: that itt seeme to be wholy fyer, and not Iron. Wee also do not esteeme the Ayr to be vnited with the sunn-beames soe long as wee can perceiue any thinge else in itt y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> light, and clearnesse. In like manner wee ought not to esteeme our soule to be vnited with <hi>God</hi> vnlesse shee be with all her Powres so wholy auerted from all Creatures, and from Herselfe, as though neither shee, nor they were at all. And being wholy Conuerted to <hi>God</hi> so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy his sacred presence that shee know, tast, or feele nothing but <hi>God,</hi> for y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> is shee first of all Perfect, and hath obtayned her end.</p>
               <p>Agayn wee doe not say that a stone rests
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:104174:19"/> vppon the earth when it is loose by the ground, or toucheth the same only with so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me corner; for it shewes the Contrary; not resting vntill it ly flat, and firme. Yea to rest the securer it imprints itselfe, as deepe in the ground as it can, and in the meane whyl: Man esteemes Himselfe to be in <hi>God,</hi> and to rest in Him when perhaps hee is so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mwhat neere vnto Him, or with some one of his Powres knoweth; or toucheth not Him, but some thing like vnto Him. Which is a Blyndnesse to be much lamented. And the more becaus many Heare, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the same; and yet are no more tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, or moued therewith then as though it did not concerne them at all; when as not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they cannot be ignorant that out of this end, no Happynesse can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
               <p>Truly if a fish should see the water, and did not make hast to leape into itt; if a stone should hang loose in the Ayr, and not fall down-wards, wee would affirme the fish to be dead, and that which seemed to be a stone, to be noe stone. What shall wee now say of Man? and to what shall wee liken him who doth not tend to his first, and pryme end? Heare what the Prophet Dauid sayth of Him. <hi>Man being in Honour did not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,</hi>

               <p>This hath ministred Occasion vnto Mee amongst diuers other Bookes which treate of the Perfection of this life: to add this small treatise. If peraduenture in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon erring; wee could by the same suggest aswell to our selues, as to others: some apt Meanes for the obtayning of our Blissed end to which wee are all created, for which wee ought all to tend, and for which wee haue all receiued our Body, and soule in this present tyme, expecting the Day in which wee must giue account how little, or much wee haue approached to our Blisled end; (which is <hi>God</hi>) and are vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Him; when as according to the Measure wee are to expect reward, or punishment.</p>

                  <hi>come.</hi> Of the Spirituall <hi>kingdome</hi> in the soule. Whereof S. Augustin had particular experience as appeareth by his words when Hee sayd: <hi>O great Depth! ô sweete secrecy! ô secrecy! without Bitternesse of bad thoughts▪ without perturbation, impugnation, or Payn</hi> This is the ioy whereof our Sauuiour said. <hi>Enter into the ioy of thy Lord.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The reason wee haue to take this name the <hi>Kingdome of God</hi> is first because euery one desires to tend thither. Who desires not to be a <hi>king?</hi> who would not to the end of the world goe ouer the sea, and Mountay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, if soe be there could be shewed Him an entrance into the <hi>kingdome</hi> of Heauen? How therefore shall any body neglect the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryn wee heere giue, to shew Him that <hi>king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> in Himselfe? Truely if to one, who with greate labour did fetch water a farr of; we should shew Him the Fountayn from whence it did flow within his owne Howse: who would not spayr the Labour of fetching itt from abroad, and enioy that Hee had within doores? where the <hi>kingdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of God</hi> is (there is <hi>God</hi>) who is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn of all Good, Beauty, and Perfection,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:104174:20"/> which Man seekes out of Himselfe with greate Labour. Yea by the <hi>kingdome of God</hi> wee vnderstand nothing else but a perfect vnion of the Soule with <hi>God.</hi> And therefore vnderstanding that the <hi>kingdome of God</hi> is within Her, each one ought to be enflamed with a greate Desire to seeke the same.</p>
               <p>Secondly because the word <hi>kingdome of God</hi> doth make best known to euery one the nature of true Perfection. For all know y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> where the <hi>kingdome of God</hi> is, there may be noe sinn, vice, bad Affection, or desire; no trouble, commotion, Mutability, or instability; no Aridity, or vexation; but through a Death of all Humayn Frayltyes,<note place="margin">True Perf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And in Truth such ought to be the Vnion of the soule with <hi>God</hi> which is her vtmost perfection, and end in this life; as was that whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>in <hi>God</hi> first placed Her. And with reason it requires the vttermost Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Man in this life; for Hee ought to rest perfectly therin, and to be able at all tymes to attayn thervnto; and albeit by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his Fraylty hee oftentymes separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:104174:21"/> himselfe from itt, and that hee cannot in this life (which is but the way to the next) come to a Constant, &amp; Perfect Rest in <hi>God,</hi> and a full satiety in him. There is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing appoynted him a certayn Vnion with <hi>God</hi> which hee may obtayn in this life, wherin hee finds a Rest, and repose in <hi>God;</hi> which is such, as doth sufficiently sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie him heere in this life; and therefore hee ought to tend vnto itt; and this Vnion must be such, that it come soe neere as can be to that of Eternall Bissednesse. And Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally be without <hi>medium</hi> or Meane, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though obscure, and in <hi>faith;</hi> whereas the other is in perfect Charity, as a full reward of this life.

For soe farr (it seemes) hee can come to, in this life.</p>
               <p>Therefore of this <hi>Kingdome of God</hi> we will heere speake teaching the soule how shee shall find <hi>God</hi> without <hi>medium</hi> or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, or any thing interposed in her, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn him in all Places, workes, Payns, and

               </argument>
               <p>IT is much to be admired: that Man who is created to the likenesse of <hi>God,</hi> &amp; hath him for his Finall End, doth soe little seeke after <hi>God,</hi> but rests soe quietly out of him. And no lesse is it to be admired that amōgst those who seeke <hi>God,</hi> soe few find him. Truely wee would say that <hi>God</hi> being Mans only end; that assoone as hee seekes after <hi>God</hi> hee ought to find him. Like as the stone soe soone as it is loose presently falls downe to the ground its proper Centre. And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding wee see dayly amongst many soules louing <hi>God</hi> who with greate coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge haue left the world, and all occasion of sinne, and apply themselues wholy to seeke <hi>God.</hi> Very few neuerthelesse come to the Perfect knowledge of <hi>God,</hi> and Vnion with him, who is their sole end.</p>

To morrow they find themselues soe estranged from <hi>God</hi> that they thinke they shall neuer attayn to him agayn. And in this maner they spend manyyeares groping, as it were blyndfold after <hi>God,</hi> that which they haue, doth not satisfie them, and to that to which they find themselues interior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moued they know not how to attayn, and amongst these, some of the faythfullest remayn all their life disquieting themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues after their beloued.

               </p>
               <p>S. Bernard saith that in seeking <hi>God</hi> wee must proceed in the same maner as wee do in seeking after any other Thing wee would gladly obtayn. Hee that seeketh any thing obserueth alwayes with greate Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence the tyme when, the Place where, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so after what manner it must be sought, &amp; enioyed. This amongst Other things wee see in the hunters that seeke to find out, and Catch the beast, or fowle. They obserue very diligently the tyme, and Place in which that Game is most commonly to be found. And besides that; haue their seuerall Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and wayes which they vse in ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ching them, according to the diuersity of the Game. Some they take with Netts, some with Doggs, others they shoot, &amp;c. In which Obseruation, if they come to misse, it
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:104174:24"/> is noe Meruayle though they catch nothing but loose their tyme, and labour in vay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and expose themselues to the laughter of Others. As for example: if one should loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke for the Herons in the midst of the corne field in the heate of summer, and hunt her with doggs, as hee would doe the hare: doubtlesse hee might iustly be counted of each one imprudent, in not better obseruing the tyme, place, and manner in Catching of that fowle. In the same manner also in seeking of <hi>God</hi> are diligently to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, the tyme, place, and manner after wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ich <hi>God</hi> is to be found; yea much more y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> in any other thing. For it might soe fall out y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the other things may be found out of their vsuall season, place &amp;c. But not <hi>God.</hi> For hee is alwayes one selfesame, symple Being in whom neuer happeneth the least Mutation of tyme, Place, or manner; And therefore albeit hee be sought seuerally by diuers in the Beginning, yet neuerthelesse all those wayes, and proceedings must at▪lenth end in one symple, and vnchangeable: that only can find him which must also be as differēt from that, by which created things are sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght after, as <hi>Gods</hi> Condition, and Nature is different from Creatures And notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding heerof is scarce any Notice taken. For as many as there be Men that seeke <hi>God</hi> so many seuerall wayes, and manners of seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there are by which they thinke to find.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:104174:24"/> him. Yea the selfesame body holdeth this day one manner of proceeding, And to morrow another. And all these haue little, or noe Consideration of the essence, and nature of <hi>God,</hi> but are so Affected as thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gh <hi>God</hi> were sensible, and Corporall, as other things are. For Manifestation heerof behold the dayly Exercises of those that see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke <hi>God,</hi> as are Meditations, Aspirations, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, and actiue Conuersions to <hi>God.</hi> By those they would gladly find <hi>God,</hi> and vnite themselues with him. For many vse these not as the first Meanes, and the beginning of the way to <hi>God:</hi> for which they are conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, and necessary, but hold them as the finall end; and to these only I direct this speech.</p>
               <p>And in truth if wee consider it well, wee shall Iudge those persons to be like vnto the hunter who would go about to catch the Heron with Doggs: not only in the Open field, but vppon the open markett Place in the view of the whole world. Yea wee shall Confesse that this would sooner happen y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> that Man through Meditation, Aspirations, and such like operatiue Exercises should ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn <hi>God.</hi> For <hi>God</hi> is more auerted from vs by reason of our Imaginary Thoughts, and framed workings, y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> the heron from the people.

               <p>Those also that seeke <hi>God</hi> are oftenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes defectiue in the Obseruance of the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me in which <hi>God</hi> must be sought, and found.

Wherin they may well be compared to a Hunter that would neuer goe a hunting, but when hee were sure the Game of itselfe would come, and meete him. But if hee were to take any paynes, or vndergo any difficulty in finding out of the Game hee would rather keepe himselfe at home.

               <p>Others there be who when they haue done their endeauour for some tyme to find <hi>God,</hi> if any occasion be offered vnto them of some corporall recreation, of sensible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light they powre themselues out wholy vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon itt; and loose on a sudden all which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with greate labour they had obtayned doing like vnto imprudent handy crafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who the first Sounday, or Holy day that comes, spends all they haue gotten with greate Labour the whole weeke before, and so remayne all their liues poore slaues.</p>
               <p>Some others there be who somety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes resist manfully there sensuality, for the finding of <hi>God:</hi> but afterwards it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth exceeding tedious to them to liue in a continuall Dying to the senses, and so out of Inconstancy of hart lett goe, and loose all that which before they had gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of themselues; and afterwards beginn a new agayn. Being like vnto one that tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vppon him to rowle a heauy stone to the Toppe of a high hill, which when with extreame Toyle, and labour hee hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the midst of the hill, or further: pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently out of lazinesse, or negligence letts it tumble downe agayn to the Bottom; and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:104174:26"/> so through lazinesse, and want of a little more Diligence spends his whole life in a continuall labour without Rest.</p>
               <p>In very truth euen after this manner, and more vnwisely do many: yea the most part of those that seeke God. Who (if it were but well demostrated vnto them by some illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated men how rudely, and vnwisely they seeke <hi>God</hi>) would be much ashamed in thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and nothing at all wonder that they do not attayn to <hi>God;</hi> making so little difference betwixt the seeking of <hi>God,</hi> and created things.</p>
               <p>But omitting this grosse kynd of erring, to be short, I only say that such men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds with <hi>God</hi> like vnto childeren which wee sometymes see after their childish ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to imitate the Church seruice, erecting an Aulter, and hauing some Image of Iesus, or other picture which they decke, &amp; trimm now after one maner, y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; sometymes carrying itt very solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with singings, and noyse; soone after it is cast behynd some chest where it lyes se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall dayes. Sometymes alsoe they trayle it along the streets. In fyne, their manner of deuyne seruice hath no other Rule, or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but only their childish Affection with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other Discretion.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:104174:27"/> Images, and similitudes of the Deuinity, or Humanity of Christ: and all their Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises are to that end. and haue no other Rule, but their sensuall appetite which as childeren they seeke in <hi>God.</hi> When they haue any sensible feeling of <hi>God</hi> y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> they are ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In very deed it is more to be admired that there are soe many of these Men to be foūd, and amongst them alsoe diuers which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise seeme to be wise, and prudent: and yet can neuer attayn to <hi>God,</hi> or know any thing of the true Vnion with <hi>God.</hi> For albeit peraduenture they keepe themselues from grosse faults they rest notwithstanding too grossely in themselues, and deserue not the name of soules seeking <hi>God;</hi> for they seeke themselues whom they also find, and hold: and not <hi>God,</hi> and cannot be said to be loose, or compared to a stone that is loose.

               <p>It were truly to be wished that some such li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke illuminated Man would shew these er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring soules clearely their errour, and with all teach them wherin they are defectiue.

               <p>And truly if the Vnion of the soule with <hi>God</hi> were but according to one powre, or part, and that with force, and labour, so that the soule could not obtayn itt alwayes: shee could not rest therin, or be contented therewith.

               <p>Now wee see many Spirituall Men to be heerin defectiue; who speake well with the Mouth concerning Perfection, and Vnion with <hi>God.</hi> But their liues, and Conuersation poynt out seuerall Imperfections which are not comparible with the true Internall Vniō with <hi>God;</hi> as the least lost tyme in vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

               </p>
               <p>The interior defect of these Men are wholy contrary to those whereof wee haue spoken in the precedent Chapter; for they erre because they remayn in the <hi>medium</hi> or meane not going forward to the end; but the latter stay or rest towards the end, and thinke they haue obtayned itt without hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or vsing competent Meanes.

So those know full well that <hi>God</hi> is to be found aboue their forces in an informity, or being without Images, and pure naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. And they apply also themselues to itt vsing diligence to come thither: but being there abouts they know not how they must behaue themselues there, &amp; how they shall gett forwards. Some notwithstanding come neerer y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> others, and all fayle not a like but in seuerall wayes grossely. For some of them yea perhapps the most part think they do
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:104174:32"/> exercise themselues in a naked fayth, and true Abnegation: and yet for all that they rest in subtile formes, or images, and are full of proper will. Such as those may well be said <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Others exercising themselues in <hi>Faith,</hi> &amp; hauing left many Exterior things for <hi>God</hi> though not all, find well in themselues some denudation from creatures: and internall Rest, and peace: and can also now, and then conuert themselues thither in themselues. And heerby they think they go right to <hi>God</hi> without hauing further thought of leauing any more. Being like to Him, that is in a shipp which, albeit it be in the sea yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse it is bound fast with a Cord to the Land, and becaus Hee looketh not out of the shipp, or heedeth the Cord wherewith it is tyed, thinks it sufficient that Hee be in it, and imagins himselfe continually to sayle forward whereas notwithstanding Hee remaynes still in the same place.</p>
               <p>Others there be that forsake all exterior things, but retayn themselues: seeking their owne comfort, interest, and ease in <hi>God.</hi> These haue the introuersion more constant, &amp; therefore think they haue obtayned <hi>God,</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:104174:32"/> or go right to Him. But they are like to one that is in a shipp departed from the Land, but is runn on a shelfe, and becaus that He is in it, holds Himselfe contented being from the Land, not considering that Hee lyeth fast. Thinks Hee sayles forward continually in the sea; and notwithstanding doth not moue.</p>
               <p>Others agayn Knowing full well that they are possessed with themselues, and that they must deny themselues to come to <hi>God,</hi> endeauour by their owne workes to doe itt, and are like vnto Him who knowing that the shipp (Hee is in) sticks fast: seekes to clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re her by plucking, and hayling at a cord which Hee hath fastned to the mast deemin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge thereby to make the shipp loose, and putt her forward in the sea, and in this meane whyle doth but Labour in vayn.</p>
               <p>Others being free from all Externall th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and from themselues also, think this is sufficient, and therefor do no more: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiuing that they so remayning shall more, &amp; more be vnited vnto <hi>God.</hi> But these are like vnto Him that being now in the sea, and from all Lands; thinks Hee is to do no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, and neither putts vpp mast, or hoysts vp sayl; deeming that the fludd of the sea will carry Him into the Hauen; and in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne tyme lyeth floating vppon the water driuen now hyther, now thyther without profiting. Lo thus many are deceiued of

They know not that being naked, and free from all creatures, they must be vnwrought, and vacant in themselues, and their Spirit raised aboue the Powre of the soule where they would perceiue the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the deuyn light by which they would be more eleuated aboue all creatures, and themselues into <hi>God.</hi> Like vnto a shipp which being in the mayn sea with full say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le by helpe of the wynd is driwen towards t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

In like maner these erring sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les (Being there is no cessation betwixt <hi>God,</hi> and nature) may perhaps remayn for some short tyme with their first feruour, and dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me they haue <hi>God,</hi> or at least are in the right way to Him; but afterwards they fall who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into Nature, or stand in strang opinions, and fantasyes, or Conuert themselues
<pb facs="tcp:104174:33"/> with danger to Creatures.</p>
               <p>And put the case that some one of these could persist in his Naturall introuersion; (without passing in the meane whyle out of Himselfe into <hi>God</hi>) this man might be said to be neere <hi>God,</hi> but not in <hi>God.</hi> And albeit that hee who is close by a thing doth in some part enioy it; yet it is not so in this.

And therefore although it may seeme that these Men approach neere to those who haue rightly found <hi>God</hi> in thē. There is neuerthelesse a greate difference betwixt them; not only interiorly, but also exteriorly in their Liues, and Conuersation which is also easy to be perceiued.

                  </gap>ing as wee haue already described the maner; that knowing the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me they may the better auoyd itt; and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby also take notice of the way which they are to hold. And as concerning the first. I beleiue that by what I haue said in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning they might discerne, why they so grossely erre from <hi>God.</hi> But the last being they are in the right way distinguishing as they ought, and also obseruing both tyme, and place to find <hi>God.</hi> How comes it that so few attayn to <hi>God?</hi> its true wee haue said that amongst them many suffer themselues to be deceiued through a false Conceit of hauing sound <hi>God,</hi> or that certaynly they shall find Him by their maner of doing. But All are not such like. How comes it then that those who lay open their fund, &amp; are rightly instructed of the truth find not <hi>God</hi> at l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ued? to this: I answere that as the defects of these people are hidden. so are also the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:104174:34"/> reasons thereof, no lesse, but much more hidden. And first although their maner of proceeding to seek <hi>God</hi> come very neere in many things to the true finall maner; neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse it is not the right, as shall appeare by that which will be said heereafter. For the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se haue both read, and heard much of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and know that <hi>God</hi> must be found vnimaginarily in an Internall Rest, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse. But they sett themselues to obtayn this more by an naturall working, y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> a Totall Abnegation. And although they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine Themselues to walke in a naked faith; yet if it were well examined, wee should find it to be otherwise, and rather accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge to the senses; and that they hue with <hi>God</hi> like childeren, as well as the former; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit more couertly; becaus they will seeme to be great Men.</p>
               <p>But although some of them had taken the right way before, yet it may for many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons fall out with them like vnto one that in the Beginning of his Iorney enters into the right way. But neuerthelesse doth not arriue at the end whyther it leads, and where hee intended. And this becaus that either hee doth not keepe, and hold on in the right way, but falls into some by-way, or other; or remayning in the right way, Hee loyters, and neglects to go forward, or some thing, or other happens vnto Him which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Him in the way.</p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:104174:35"/>
               <p>In like maner it hapens to soules who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue sometymes apprehended the right way: but becaus it is exceeding narrow, and hath many by-wayes on euery-syde which our crafty nature hath made: (the soul follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as the shadow the Body which hydeth the right way from her, and sheweth Her the deceitfull) it falleth out that many good Men that had begunn well do declyne from the right way, and make a wrong ending.</p>
               <p>Others there be that suffer not themselues to be drawen from the right way, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus they loyter much, and goe slowly, and fayntly on (where notwithstanding the way is all clyming being against nature, and sensuality, and therefore admitts no stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing still) th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> fall by little, and little back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards agayn, and become like as they we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re before.</p>
               <p>Others agayn who couragiously going on the way with greate desyre of perseuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the end, meetinge afterwards with Obscurityes, Aridities, internall Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Afflictions (which thinking to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oyd) they declyn from the way, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluing to breake through, (but becaus they know not how to behaue themselues therin) they sticke fast. And so not any of them doe reach to the Place where <hi>God</hi> is to be found.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding the cheifest origin of all the e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rors aswell of the former as of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:104174:35"/> straying soules, is becaus they doe not on their parts sufficiently endeauour to find <hi>God:</hi> but would haue Him at too easy a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, and so fayl all; becaus they seeke not <hi>God</hi> at all tymes, and Places. This is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon defect which is the caus why so few find <hi>God</hi> truly. For if they did vse all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to that end, although they had many grosse defects in them; yea, and many also of them vnknown vnto them, they would in tyme discouer them, and although they went much about neuerthelesse they would at lēgth come into the right way. For throu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gh the continuall seeking after <hi>God</hi> at all ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, and in all places nature by degrees is depressed, and Brought vnder, and on the othersyde the Spiritt becomes more bare, &amp; eleuated into <hi>God.</hi> Also by reason of her fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie, <hi>God</hi> would without doubt enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten her, and giue her grace to surpasse all impediments, and at length to find him.</p>
               <p>But the Blocke they all stumble att, is want of perseuerance, and diligence, being too greate louers of themselues, and neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to performe that which they know must necessarily go befor the finding of <hi>God;</hi> or peraduenture not knowing that there must be such a vigilant care had before wee come to find <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in truth it is very hard to perswade any one what difficulties there are to be passed before wee can attayn to <hi>God</hi> vnlesse
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:104174:36"/> hee haue already gon the way; hee cannot apprehend that there is required such a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, or entirenesse of Himselfe; and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall a perseuerance without intermission, or Relaxation. They read of this often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough, &amp; it is oftentymes told them, but they take it shorter y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> the Bookes, or writers doe meane itt; which happeneth perchance, because they expresse Perfection in so few words, and the way leading ther vnto: pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing itt in an internall Death, Abnegation, Annihilation &amp;c. These few words shew the beginning, and ending of the way but not that which goeth between, or how farr these two be a sunder; they be short, and intelligible, but comprehend more y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> wee imagin as will appeare heereafter when wee shall explicate them; and hence are these ignorant Men deceiued.</p>
               <p>It Happeneth to them like vnto one that vewes the whole world delienated or drawn in a small Mapp, or vppon a little globe wherin are represented all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys of the world with little distance the one from the other. For if Hee haue no kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wledg in that science, and only Iudg ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his grosse visible sight. Hee will thinke Himselfe not farr from spayn, Italy, the Indyes &amp;c. where notwithstanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Hee could arriue to those places Hee must spend a long tyme with the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going of greate labour, and trauell. In like
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:104174:36"/> maner the Spirituall writers who in their words affect Breuity, exhibitt Perfection vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, and describe the way leading thither with short, and compendious words; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas notwithstanding, it is longer y frō the one end of the world to the Other. For Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is an Vnion with <hi>God,</hi> to which, the only way is to leaue the whole world, &amp; all creatures as heerafter shall appeare. Which distance, when the vulgar People do not rightly consider how they are to vnderstand itt being comprised in these breif words before related; they esteeme the way to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to be farr shorter, and easier y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> it is, and apply themselues to itt coldly, &amp; faynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and therefore come rarely to the end, yea scarsly to the halfe way.</p>
               <p>Wherefor Heereafter wee will put this mapp at lenth withall distances speaking of the way which leadeth to <hi>God,</hi> How long, and how broad it is, where it lyeth, and what thereto is required all which wee will demonstrate in particular.</p>
               <p>But now wee intend only to speake of the Continuance, and constancy which is required of the soules part to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse in the said way, and to pursue the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to the end. Which I will declare vnto Her not with many words, but by this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon similitude. Suppose, that one were pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing along where a suift Riuer were issuing forth of a high Moūtayn: in case Hee would
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:104174:37"/> go downe-wards; the current by reason of its swift down-fall would carry him very easily, and roundly; but if hee would goe vp the riuer towards the hight of the hill hee must of necessitie with continuall La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour stern the bark against the streame, and so by perpetuall striuing forwards would at length come to the spring, and origin of the Riuer. And as often as hee neglected to Labour, hee would presently through vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the flood be driuen backe agayn, and loose that which before hee had gayned with so great Labour, and consequently would neuer reach to the spring head.</p>
               <p>Behold after this maner, is also the way to <hi>God,</hi> All Mens, senses, powres, and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections since his first fall are diuerted from <hi>God,</hi> and runn suiftly, and continually downwards through the midst of Creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, as a flowing water through the midst of the earth. The Spirit being vnited there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto is as it were forced to condescend like a barke being vppon the streame, and thus is the whole Man very easily, and without Labour carryed down wards to wards crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. But if Hee desire to conuert his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit vpwards to <hi>God,</hi> that is against the strea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. (For the Inclynation of his senses is cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually drawing him downwards towards the earth, and earthly things) and haue an Intention to come to <hi>God.</hi> Hee must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so resolue to labour without cessation,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:104174:37"/> and striue against the streame of his Naturall Affections, and inclinations. And if Hee cease neuer so little from striuing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; instantly they carry him downwards backe agayn from <hi>God,</hi> and make him loose all which before with so much labour hee had gayned. Yet if wee consider itt well, wee shall confesse that hee who conuerteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to <hi>God</hi> hath need to be more carefull, more diligent, and more perseuerant y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> hee that roweth against the streame. Becaus hee must not only force the boate, but the very Riuer itselfe, hee must violently carry it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards against its naturall current. For all his senses powres, and Affections hee must for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly (contrary to their naturall Inclination) compell inwards, and draw them vpwards to <hi>God.</hi> For the Spirit Alone without them can effect nothing neither can there be any perfect Vnion with <hi>God</hi> where all the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wres are not wholy absorpt in <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And although this do happen without forcing of the powres (as heerafter shall be shewed) notwithstanding there is required exceeding greate Diligence, and a most vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant Obseruation of ones selfe withall the Powres without ceasing. Which Obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the beginning must be with more diligence, care, and continuance; by reason that the Powrs, senses, and Affections (wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ich although they be from all exterior, dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wn inwards to <hi>God</hi>) cannot yet so soone
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:104174:38"/> rest quietly in him hauing not as yet so sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and firme an Introuersion to <hi>God:</hi> and do easily of themselues suarue outwards agayn, so that for a tyme they are like vnto a Water without banks which easily floweth out on euery syde till such tyme as it hath settled itselfe deeper into the ground, and made a residence: where it lyeth included, &amp; cannot runn out. Therefor a beginner must withall possible diligence obserue, and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe together all his Powres till such tyme as they haue situated themselues in the botto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of the soule, and as in a deepe profundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty vnited, and quietly resided.</p>
               <p>Which continuall custody, and watch ouer ones selfe is sufficiently manifested by that which already hath beene said, viz: that the Perfect deuyn presence which wee seeke, is such, that as it may, so also it must at all Tymes, and in all places to the vttermost endeauour, and Powre of the soule be kept, which is, not obtayned by her otherwise, y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> by a perfect Vnion with the same. So that (as appeareth by what hath beene sayed) to seeke <hi>God</hi> as wee ought, the whole Man at all tymes, and places according to his vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Ability must apply himselfe thervnto. And yet notwithstanding becaus all Mans Perseuerance is too vnstable, and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy too mutable he shall neuer find <hi>God</hi> rightly so long as hee remayneth in his own forces, (as shall heereafter be shewed)
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:104174:38"/> vnlesse besides this present seeking through Annihilation of his owne doings deriued from a Totall Resignation of himselfe to <hi>God,</hi> hee come into one constant <hi>now</hi> in which <hi>God</hi> is perfectly present. For Albeit the soule doth her vttermost endeauour at all tymes, and Places to obtayn <hi>God.</hi> It is not becaus <hi>God</hi> is properly so found in ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, and place, for hee is farr aboue them; But it is becaus the soule which before at all tymes, and places was out of <hi>God,</hi> lost in the midst of Creatures; should return to herselfe, being that shee in tyme, and place standeth vnder <hi>God,</hi> and so by little, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle mount aboue herselfe where shee fyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a constant Eternity in which <hi>God</hi> is present without Meane.

In so much that this want of such perpetuall custody, and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of himselfe is the Occasion of All er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and Wauering of the soule. Who shall be able to amond this perfectly? Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing itt must thus be layd open clearely to the soule. For otherwise shee makes too light of itt. And knowes not what it contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or how much is required to the true finding of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When one hath a greate iorney to go it is good hee be premonished of the Length, &amp; Tediousnesse of the way: to the end that hee may better prepare himselfe least peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture finding more Labour, and trauayl y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> hee expected itt proue too irkesom vnto him. For Darts forseene doe the lesse harme, And expected payns are lesse troublesome. Wherefore wee haue giuen this premonitiō to the soules seeking <hi>God</hi> before wee put thē vppon the way to <hi>God.</hi> And if they will vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand vs well, that which wee haue sayd is not so difficult, as it soundeth. Yea it is no more difficult, y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> wee our selues make itt. For all the difficulty comes of our parts, and not <hi>Gods.</hi> It is not becaus <hi>God</hi> is so farr from vs, or so hard to be found, that so much is required for the finding of him. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus wee are so farr from him, so busied and vnprepared, and so hardly can appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:104174:39"/> how Hee must be found. Hee that through his own stupidity, and ignorance seeketh in forraign Countreys with great Labour, and Trauayl, That which Hee hath within Doores, cannot iustly say that such a Thing is Hard to be found, becaus hee taketh such greate payns in seeking the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof. Hee also who hath many encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances, and is vnprepared to go, and seeke his friend who expects him, and is ready to entertayn Him; ought not to complayn that his friend is hard to be found; or that hee must take a greate deale of payns to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to Him. Becaus hee cannot free Himself, and make himself ready to go to Him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much Labour, for that is his own fault.</p>
               <p>In like maner the deuout soule although shee vndergo a greate deale of Difficulty to come to <hi>God</hi> with manyfold, and prolix Meditations, and corporall Exercises seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>God</hi> out of herselfe: or albeit an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortifyed Man fyndeth greate trouble, and difficulty to introuert Himselfe to <hi>God</hi> by reason of his badd inclination which hee adheres, and which continually draweth Him thence. Neither the one, or the other hath iust reason to complayn that <hi>God</hi> is hard to be found. For aswell the One, as the Other doe caus to themselues this Labour. The one seeking abroad that which Hee hath present within; and the other willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adhering to things from which hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:104174:40"/> free himselfe without difficulty. All the Obstacles which make it so difficult vnto vs to find <hi>God,</hi> and stayes vs from Him, are on our Parts; And woe haue nothing to do but only with ourselues, and therefore they are the lesse to be reguarded.</p>
               <p>If it were not for these impediments on our parts, it would be very easy for vs to haue <hi>God</hi> always present. And truly the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why those who haue no greate impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements in themselues do not find <hi>God,</hi> is, becaus hee may so easily be found. For as the soule can scarse conceiue how inwardly <hi>God</hi> is present vnto Her; so can shee hardly vnderstand how simply, and playnly shee must apply herselfe to this most inward pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. And yet much lesse can shee perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me the same, as shee ought amongst her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, and internall doings. There is none soe fac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll, as this; when shee hath once the knowledge thereof: yea to turne her eye to the light that is before Her, is not more easy vnto Her, y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> to turne herselfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to <hi>God</hi> as will appeare by that wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ich shall be said heereafter, and hath already beene said: to witt that <hi>God</hi> is the finall end, the life; the proper centre, and resting pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of the soule, to whom shee hath an natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Inclinatiō, as the stone hath to the earth. A stone falleth very easily, and without La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; euen of itselfe, when it is loose. So in like maner, the Spirit of Man of its own
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:104174:40"/> parts turns itselfe with facility, yea of itselfe, to <hi>God;</hi> and all the difficulty is in the separation of the soule from Affection to Creatures, and Herselfe. This doth cost her Labour, and tyme: like as a stone somety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes lyeth so fast that it cannot be loosened without great labour, and difficulty.</p>
               <p>But Hee who hath not experienced itt, cannot beleiue itt; and therefore he seekes with great care, and sollicitude, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth without necessity giuing himselfe work which afterwards hee cannot leaue without Labour, and difficulty: and yet must leaue it, before hee can proceed further. So that, but improperly, and for want of experince Men vsually say that the way to <hi>God</hi> is hidden, obscure, and sublyme: It is in vs, and our behalfe whence all obscurity, and difficulty proceeds. Wee are too much cleuated in our senses, and proper Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and will order deuyn things accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our grosse, and humayn vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and not our selues to them. And this is manifest if wee consider that which the sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le doth to find <hi>God,</hi> and hold him. To witt by abstraction abnegation, Obliuion, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation, Symplification, vnloosing, Rest &amp;c: (as wee shall heereafter declare) which is a signe that the soule before had more, and was more y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> shee should.</p>
               <p>And like as the right maner to find <hi>God</hi> of itt selfe is very light, and easy to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:104174:41"/> so is it also to be held, and kept. For when the soule hath once found itt: shee shall haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It is with Him as with a feather which the Higher it is in the Ayr the apter it is to fly aloft; but if it once touch the ground it becometh most fowle, and vnapt to be ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated agayn into the Ayr.

But when it desists from as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending, and giues way to the senses, it presently becomes more slow, and worse disposed to eleuate itselfe again towards <hi>God.</hi> So that in this continuall seeking of

                  <hi>God</hi> is Labour without Payn, work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out toyle, trauell without wearynesse, yea strenth, and refreshing.

               </argument>
               <p>NOW to reduce these soules seeking <hi>God</hi> from their errors into the right way, who want no good will, and desire to leaue All, and performe what is required of them to find <hi>God.</hi> It may sooner be done by some playn similitude; y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> by prolix, and subtil reasons which they apprehend accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their curious, and humayn vnderst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anding, and do not tak them in that simple, &amp; naked manner in which they be spoken, and layd before them; making seuerall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations thereof, and putting them in practise euery one according to his best lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Wherewith they remayn effigiated or full of Images in their owne sense, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. So that oftentymes much reading doth rather hinder them y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> further them to <hi>God;</hi> especially in the beginning; and it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for one to haue a short, and cleere me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to which hee did hold himselfe, and endeauoured faythfully to put in Execution, y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> manifold Doctrins, and instructions. Wherefore as by an Externall similitude wee haue made known the caus of the Erring of those soules who seek <hi>God</hi> without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:104174:44"/> distinctiō, &amp; Obseruation; wee will shew also, with a symple, and common simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude by which each one may apprehend expressely what kynd of way it is to <hi>God,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee giue to vnderstand which it is; that the soule may the better discerne how farr shee is from <hi>God;</hi> and how shee must come to him; and consequently the better com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, and more assuredly enter into the way which wee will shew her: and courad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously prosecute the same to the very end.</p>
               <p>It comes y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> to my mynd that wee must deale with these foules which stray thus frō <hi>God,</hi> (as hath beene said) and cannot find Him rightly; as wee would do with one that doth not know what, or where the Ayr is; but would seek the same, and be gladly instructed how Hee should find itt. For these two do erre much a like, and must be brought by one way to the knowledg of the Truth. And although it may seeme strang to many, that I say thus; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing so it is. For as the Body is in the Ayr, moueth itselfe in itt, enioyeth itt, and liueth in it; in lik manner is the soule in <hi>God,</hi> the enioying of whom is her life. And it is, as much without reason that shee at any tyme misse, or loose Him; as the Body the Ayr. <hi>Fayth,</hi> Scripture, and reason itselfe do mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest this Truth sufficiently; that it is needles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se to vse many words in Confirmation heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And therefor wee will content ourselues

               <p>Lett vs take a Man whom wee suppose to be exceeding dull, and Ignorant of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of naturall things: yea of the 4. ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments also. And put the case Hee would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the same with his vnderstanding, and now hauing had many considerations of the conditions, and nature of the earth, water, and fire which Hee can see, and feele with his Hands; and hence easily know the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertyes wee ascribe vnto them would go on, and by Himselfe fall into Consideration of the Ayr being the 4. Element; and becaus
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:104174:45"/> Hee doth not see itt, imagine itt to be farr from Him; and hence should frame many strang Conceits, Imaginations, and simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes by which hee would gladly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the nature, and condition of this ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to what hee had heard, or read of it, or seene, or obserued in the other 3. Elements, or in case Hee knew well that the Ayr is round about him should behold, and take the clearnesse, and lightsomnesse of the sunne for it, or at leastwise the cold, or heat which hee felt without; or lastly should imagine that the Ayr were nothing else but the <hi>vacuum</hi> or empty distance wee behold betweene the 3. Elements. How much more this Ignorant man should busy his Brayn heerin▪ and iudge according to his externall grosse senses, So much the lesse would hee reach to conceiue what the Ayr is in itselfe. And would fayle more, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re in the true knowledge thereof.</p>
               <p>To this Rude, and ignornat man (in myne Opinion) may well be compared the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said soules seeking <hi>God.</hi> For becaus they do not perceiue <hi>Gods</hi> presence; they imagine <hi>God</hi> to be farr from them.

               <p>And like as this Rude vnderstanding man to find the Ayr in this <hi>vacuum,</hi> or Empty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse must desist from beholding it outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and must in it conuert Him to Himselfe thereby to come to the knowledg of the Ayr which hee actually enioyeth in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptynesse.

               <p>First of all the foresaid rude man hauing
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:104174:47"/> vnderstood that which wee haue told him of the Ayr, must giue creditt to it, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging his former grosse mistaking, hee shall cast away all formes, likenesses, and Imoginations which Hee framed in vayne of the Ayr; as also shall no more imagine the light which hee did see; or heate, or cold which hee felt to be the Ayr, nor the vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and emptynesse which he held to be it, but shall lett go all things of the Ayr. For hee knowes they be not needfull to make it present to him. And Hee also perceiues that by these Hee turnes Himselfe outwards frō himselfe, and from the Ayr, and is hindred also from obseruing in himselfe how hee cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually (not knowing) enioyes the Ayr. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly hee shall conuert himselfe to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior Vacancy, and Emptynesse which hee heeres to be the proper place of the Ayr, and shall therin leaue himselfe with great Quietnesse as hauing by him that which hee sought outwardly; and y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> introuerting, hee shall by that marke how hee is continually in the ayr, and the Ayr in him, and how hee always enioyeth the same although hee do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h not reflect vppon it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly hee shall do this feeling, or obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation with greate simplicity, so that as then hee shall make no Image, or forme of the ayr; (for hee obserues, that thereby hee is lead backe from himselfe outwards) but without all Imaginary shape, Hee shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:104174:47"/> Himselfe to the taking, and letting go of his Breath by which Hee continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues, and enioyes the ayr in Himselfe. And hee will presently attayn to a more cleare, and certayn knowledg of the condition, &amp; nature of the ayr y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> Hee euer had by his senses, or vnderstanding of any other thing.</p>
               <p>Behold in this manner must the soule ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Herselfe to enioy <hi>God.</hi> First shee must giue Herselfe wholy captiue in whatsoeuer our <hi>Fayth</hi> propounds vnto her of <hi>God.</hi> To<note place="margin">Fayth the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le.</note> witt; that Hee is euery where present vnto Her; notwithstanding inuisible, insensible, and incomprehensible. And so consequently shee must willingly leaue of Her former Imaginary formes, intellectuall obseruatiōs, and all operatiue seeking of <hi>God.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiuing no more that the light, or <hi>vacuum</hi> which shee perceiues in herselfe, is <hi>God,</hi> for by that shee doth contrary to her <hi>fayth,</hi> and estrangeth herselfe from <hi>God</hi> as the rude man doth from the Ayr, yea much more.</p>
               <p>And it is to be noted well, what I say; that the soule must leaue of all Operatiue seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>God</hi> to attayn to the enioying of him. For this is the first thing which a soule seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>God</hi> (that already hath ridd herselfe of sinne, and all grosse impediments betwixt <hi>God,</hi> and Her) ought to know, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding is by very few rightly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood. They know full well they must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquish
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:104174:48"/> all formes, and also all feelings to come to <hi>God,</hi> but yet they seeme to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of leauing of that operatiue seeking of <hi>God,</hi> or if they know it, neuerthelesse they do not forsak it, but seeke <hi>God</hi> after this manner: as though they knew not. And this is that which I principally intended by this similitude to teach the soule.</p>
               <p>I say therefore that a faithfull soule that will find <hi>God</hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ightly must besides all shapes, and similitudes; omitt also all operatiue seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that her Conuersion to <hi>God</hi> must be so simple, and quiet, that properly it may not be tearmed a seeking of <hi>God:</hi> or if it be so, that y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> shee shall not find <hi>God,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though shee were free from all Other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. And to demonstrate this, Marke, that wee seeke that which wee haue not, or are vncertayn where it is, and by reason there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of wee reuolue in mynd: whither wee shall obtayn it, or no; hence wee are sollicitous, and Labour to g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tt it; otherwise when wee certaynely know where the thing is, and that wee cannot misse itt: wee are not said to seeke the same when wee compose our selues to haue it, but go to fetch it, or if wee haue it by vs, to take it, or to conuert our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to itt, which doth not happen with Care, solicitude, Labour, feare, or the like, but with a perfect Quietnesse, and certayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty without trouble of Mynd. In like maner. For that amōgst all created things wee haue
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:104174:48"/> nothing so neere vnto vs, and so certayn as the ayr. Wee are not properly said to seeke the ayr, and therefor the Ignorance of the foresaid Rude man should rightly be tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a folly, and lacke of Iudgement. Yea knowing Himselfe to be so neere the ayr hee must lett go all his seeking after it: oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erwise hee will neuer come to the true kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wledg of it.</p>
               <p>Now being the soule hath <hi>God</hi> alwayes in Her, and that shee is continually in him, and can lesse loose him y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> the Ayr, yea y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> her owne selfe; and since shee by <hi>fayth</hi> is certayn of this; shee must by no meanes see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke <hi>God</hi> with sollicitude, carefullnesse, or feare; otherwise shee doth more against all reason, y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> if she so sought the Ayr in which shee liues; but her Conuersion to <hi>God</hi> must be in perfect Peace, Rest, and certaynty. And in case shee should seeke him sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tously shee would lesse find him, y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> the other Man the ayr. The reason is. Becaus <hi>God</hi> is only to be found in tranquillity, and peace of mynd which as appeareth cannot stand with seeking. For as hath beene sayd that brings with it grosse working, feare, sollicitude, Anxietie, and breeds disquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the Soule. Wherefore shee must wholy relinquish all sollicitous hunting▪ and seeking after <hi>God,</hi> for therby shee hinders herselfe from coming to the finding, and enioying of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:104174:49"/>
               <p>Notwithstanding I meane not this of an immortifyed Man, and beginner; who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit by his essence hee be neare to <hi>God,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse is farr from him according to his Affection, and all his powres; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently that beleife of <hi>Gods presence</hi> awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens him not to loue, and seek <hi>God</hi> purely in all things; to such an one I intend not hee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re to speake. For hee must vse imaginary, and forcible reasons to draw his will with Violence from all Creatures, and to conuert it to <hi>God,</hi> and this must hee do with labour care, and diligence as one who seeketh after a thing. Notwithstanding lett him by little, and little beginn to carry himselfe towards the foresaid <hi>faith</hi> which teacheth him that hee is in <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> in him, and esteeme himselfe not to be out of the being of <hi>God</hi> although peraduenture hee be out of his Grace▪ and friendshipp. But shall thinke himselfe to be as a Bird that is tyed to the Ground, or sitts some where included or shut vp; shee seekes not the ayr albeit shee endeauours, and striues what she can to free herselfe from the band wherewith shee is tyed, or to gett out of the Cage where shee is held fast; and that becaus shee knoweth well where the ayr is, what holds her out of itt; and how shee must come into itt agayn.</p>
               <p>In like manner a beginner if hee will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his operatiue Exercises to <hi>God</hi> with
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:104174:49"/> profitt, hee must not do them as if <hi>God</hi> were farr from him, and hee therefore would seek him. But firmely beleiueth that hee hath <hi>God</hi> inwardly present, yea as neer, as neere can be. His intention therefore shall be by these externall operatiue exercises to loose, and free himselfe from all that holds him out of <hi>God;</hi> as the bird doth from all that which keepes her out of the ayr; and enkindle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in the loue of <hi>God</hi> who is so inwardly present vnto him that thereby hee may co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to find <hi>him</hi> in himselfe; and enioy <hi>him.</hi> So that when wee are so often admonished to seeke <hi>God:</hi> it is to be vnderstood either for those who by reason of their sinns haue se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded themselues from <hi>God,</hi> and are called back agayn to him, as though they were to come from a farr to him; or also for others that walk out of the foresaid <hi>fayth,</hi> and heed not much to seek <hi>God</hi> after the best manner, or to encrease, and go forward in his Loue.</p>
               <p>But a soule who hath sequestred herselfe from all creatures for <hi>God,</hi> and is enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the true <hi>fayth</hi> of <hi>Gods presence</hi> in her (to whom heere wee properly speak) must repute it for a great impediment to seek <hi>God</hi> operatiuely; and shee must reflect well on this. For it is a hidden defect from which few are free. Of which S. Bernard seemeth to speak, saying. <hi>Like as</hi> God <hi>is louely, so is hee also wonderfull: for when Hee is not sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:104174:50"/> hee is found, and Hee is not found, when Hee is sought for.</hi> Whereof, wee therefor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> haue spoken more lardgly, not knowing any thing to expresse it better y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> this similitude of the ayr which wee haue propounded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the soule; that being in the way in which wee will presently sett her, shee remember this, and holding herselfe fast to the <hi>faith,</hi> behaue herselfe in the same manner inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to <hi>God</hi> as shee doth externally to the Ayr, in such wise that whatsoever presents itselfe before her shee seek <hi>God</hi> no more, y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> shee seekes the Ayr; conuerting herselfe with such Quietnesse, peace, and certaynty as shee doth to the Ayr which shee cannot miss; and although shee do not presently perceiue <hi>him.</hi> Yet neuerthelesse shee shall for as much as concerns that hold herselfe as Quiet in mynd, and as well content, as though shee actually had <hi>God</hi> in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as shee desired, and according to her wish; knowing that <hi>hee</hi> is neuer a whit lesse in her, nor shee in <hi>him.</hi> And keeping herselfe to this tranquillity all impediments, and <hi>mediums,</hi> or meanes betweene <hi>God,</hi> and her must by little, and little vanish away.</p>
               <p>The second thing which the soule is to performe to come to the enioying of <hi>God,</hi> is, that hauing now left all sollicitous seeking, and Laborious conuersion to <hi>God,</hi> shee must yet more imitate the former rude Man, and gathering together all her powres, and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:104174:50"/> in a perfect Rest, and peace, diligently reflect vppon the hidden presence of <hi>God</hi> in her. For being that <hi>God</hi> is not to be found without her, but within her, so must shee conuert herselfe to herselfe, and there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template how shee is in Him, and hee in Her; and therevnto shee must apply her whole Cogitation only excluding all Labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and Troblesome seeking; as is before said. And this Vnion of all her Powrs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether is easily by her performed when once the <hi>faith</hi> of the internall presence of <hi>God</hi> hath liuely gone before. For when the <hi>will</hi> knoweth assuredly that shee hath by Her what shee desired, and sought for; shee holds herselfe contented, and doth not driue, and force the others powrs any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re outwards.</p>
               <p>Thirdly the soule being thus in herselfe recollected shee must performe that Reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vppon the presence of <hi>God,</hi> With great simplicity; so that shee herselfe do not fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me the least Image thereof. For if the other rude person may conceiue no shape of the Ayr, but thereby hee is auerted from the ayr outwards, which hee interiorly enioyeth. In like manner, the soule in her Conuersion to <hi>God</hi> can frame no similitude, but is thereby much more hindered (y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> the other) in her enioying of <hi>God;</hi> and her recollecting of her Powrs within herselfe would little au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ayl, if shee admitted any kind of forme. To
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:104174:51"/> this simplicity shee must force vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, captiuating it in that <hi>faith</hi> which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that <hi>God</hi> is inuisible, insensible, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible.</p>
               <p>And this is very difficult to the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at the first: becaus it is contrary to its inclination, and its accustomed manner of proceeding, neuerthelesse the more it is cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuated, and kept vnder from all euaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and wand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ring, and blynded in the obscurity of <hi>faith:</hi> the easier, and better will the soule be able to apply herselfe to this simplicity. And becaus much consisteth in this; and in that which heerafter wee will say, the knowledg whereof will giue the soule greate cleernesse, and light; so lett vs exhibitt vnto her by another similitude how shee shall thus captiuate, and blynd all her busy vnderstanding.</p>
               <p>It is in this point with the vnderstanding of Man as with a horse which is broken out of the stable, and hath runn a long tyme wild who can hardly be brought agayn into the stable; becaus Hee hath runn so long at his own Liberty, and hath an auersion from being tyed vpp agayn, and put in the stall when you haue brought him to the Stable doore, hee is presently affrighted leapes backeward, and will not passe the thresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and if you will leade him in, you must blyndfold him, and so you may leade him without difficulty: for Hee knoweth not
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:104174:51"/> whither you lead him. Man in like manner after that he hath distracted himselfe from the Vnion with <hi>God,</hi> and Prowred himselfe forth by inordinate Affections vppon crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; his vnderstanding becometh so filled with multiplicity, and so implicated, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in Creatures, and estranged from the deuyne <hi>vnity;</hi> that it cannot be brought backe thither agayn, and though it can in some sort barr it selfe from externall Images: yet when that you would lead itt into the hidden <hi>Diety,</hi> it always flyeth backwards to<note place="margin">In the clowd of saith</note> its former Images, and similitudes. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you will haue it to enter in, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary you blyndfold it with the dark vayle of <hi>fayth,</hi> captiuating it blyndly in all that <hi>fayth</hi> doth teach vs concerning <hi>God,</hi> and y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> will it follow easily wheresoeuer you will leade it. Loe heere by an externall similitude which the soule may easyly apprehend, wee haue begunn to shew her what the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the way is, which shee must enter into to come to <hi>God.</hi> And although in these comparisons shee finds a greate disparity; becaus shee can easily collect all her powres on the presence of the ayr, but not without great difficulty vppon the presence of <hi>God;</hi> yet neuertheless shee must certaynely know that, that cometh only by reason of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, and want of practise.

Victor, saying. <hi>Hee that conuerts Himself into Himselfe, and passing through Himselfe, and eleuates Himselfe about himselfe: hee as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth rightly to God.</hi> The reason is, becaus <hi>God</hi> is not round about, and in the soule as the ayr about, and in the Body, but is so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymmately present that hee is said to be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue her. Hence S. Augustine sayth. <hi>God is more inward vnto vs, y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> our interiour.</hi> If hee be more inward vnto vs, y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> our interior. So
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:104174:52"/> is hee without, and aboue vs, through the great inwardnesse: and therefore the soule cannot come to him, or enioy him vntill shee passe through herselfe. Which how to putt in Execution, can in no wise be learned out of the Comparison of the Ayr being too ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, and grosse for this purpose. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though wee can frame no Image thereof, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse it is a Body, and after a corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and sensible manner is receiued, and enioyed by our Body. And there is no other similitude by which wee can well expresse vnto the soule, and giue her properly to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand this hidden introuersion, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of her aboue herselfe. Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing becaus shee is not accustomed to dwell in herselfe, and thereby this introuersion, and eleuation is altogether vnknown vnto her, and very obscure, wee will endeauour the best wee can to frame some likenesse which will make cleare this secret internall way to <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Like therefore as a Man that would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiuely consider, and reflect how his sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le doth inwardly flow into all the parts of the Body giuing life vnto them, and would to that end interiorly apply himselfe to that Consideration. It would be necessary that hee did withdraw all his senses, and powres not only from all Externall things, but euen from his owne Body, as much as possible. Neither must hee conuert himselfe to any
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:104174:53"/> certayn Place of himselfe. For that would agayn cast presently an Image, and the least Image doth wholy hinder him that hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not settle himselfe in this nudation, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme this symple, and Internall Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but must quite forgett tyme, place, and all that is corporall, yea his Introuersion itselfe must be empty, and Vacant, and must force his soule, as much as is possible to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert itselfe to the state wherin shee will be when shee is separated from the Body; and y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> with great simplicity▪ and Vniformity quickly obserue how equally shee floweth through all the members of the Body. One that is very Quiet in mind, and well dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed might in some sort performe the same, yet becaus, hee cannot thus stand naked, and bare, nor can keepe himselfe thus interiorly simple, and Vniforme, therefore hee is in no wise able to obserue distinctly the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of his soule in his Body, and her like vniforme influence into each member, but hath only a swift kynd of intelligence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which soone passeth away.</p>
               <p>But suppose a man would yet more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly enter into himselfe, and with a dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per introuersion conuert himselfe to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry first of-spring, and origin from whence hee thinkes his soule to flow, and on which her life, and being doth continually depend: then were it needfull that hee introuerted all his powres, senses, and his whole soule,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:104174:53"/> not only from his Body, but euen from his owne selfe with incomparable greater sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> before. For like as y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> the least ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haesion to any corporall Obiect would haue imprinted some forme, and hinder him that hee could not place himselfe in that foresaid pure nudation, and Barenesse. So would likewise now the least cleauing to, &amp; work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the powrs wholy lett him that hee would not be able to sett himselfe to this vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp; finall nudation, or conuert himself so interiorly to eleuate himselfe aboue himself. So that hee himselfe (aboue, and besides his Introuersiō, in that simple, &amp; vniforme mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and refle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ing vppon the said hidden of-spring, and beginning) must also stand vacant. For by thus actuating the soule re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes still in herselfe, and is vnapt to be eleuated aboue herselfe, in so much that the soule according to all her powres must not only be bare, and naked but also vnwrought and vacant. And like as shee to come into herselfe, must forgett all externall things in such sort, as if they were not at all; so to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me aboue herselfe shee must forgett euen her owne selfe, yea in such a manner loose her owne shape, and similitude, as though shee were not at all, and persisting thus na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, vnwrought, and annihilated, shee must yet through a higher powre be eleuated aboue herselfe; for nothing done by her can reach so high, as to come aboue, and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:104174:54"/> herselfe. So that introuersion is not only very difficult, and hard, as the former: but altogether impossible to be effected by the soule, and her sole forces. For heere shee must remayn inward, wholy contrary to her naturall Inclination, and disposition which shee hath according to the state of her sinnfull Body.</p>
               <p>Neuerthelesse in this manner it is, that the soule must stand interiorly, when shee wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uld conuert her aboue herselfe vnto <hi>God,</hi> who is the true of-spring, and the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn from whence the soule is deriued, and continually dependeth, as the Beames de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend of the sunne. And therefor all her Powres must not only be bare, and naked, but also vnwrought, and simplifyed. So that shee through a totall auersion comes to an obliuion of herselfe, and looseth as perfectly her owne Image, and similitude; as shee hath (by the act of perfect auersion) lost the formes, and shapes of all other created things without Her; in such wise, as that they in respect of Her, are, as if they were not, so shee to her owne selfe is so annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as if shee had no Being at All.</p>

And that the gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se working of her senses, and Powres do no whit helpe, and auayle Her in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And being that the Truth of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Doctryn doth cheifly rest vppon this, as vppon its foundation: lett vs yet by a clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re similitude demonstrate that the powre with which the soule must find <hi>God</hi> in Her, and know Him cannot be discouered nor made apt to conuert Herselfe to <hi>God,</hi> saue only by the foresaid maner. To witt, by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion, Abnegation, Nudation, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation.</p>
               <p>Man is created to the Image of <hi>God</hi> which remaynes yet in Him although very much difigured, defiled, and wholy vnlike to the first noble <hi>Being.</hi> And in this, and by this Image Hee must know <hi>God</hi> in Him. And as much as Hee rightly discouers, and finds this Image, so much, and no more doth hee discouer, and find out <hi>God</hi> in himselfe. And it is impossible for him to attayn to <hi>God</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till hee hath found this Image, cleansed itt, and brought it to his first nobility, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. For the internall powre by which hee must Conuert himselfe to <hi>God</hi> beares this Image in itt.</p>
               <p>Now suppose there were an Artificiall picture which the cheife Artists of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rld had drawn forth, or paynted for a pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me

And if peraduenture any other Maister of the Trade should by caruing, or paynting add any thing vnto itt, hee would but obscure, and spoyle the first Art, and take away the Beauty thereof.

               <p>I know heere no fitter comparison for our purpose y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> that which before wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to compare itt; to wit, vnto a nauiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at sea. For albeit, that all which is to be effected, and done by Her, is close by her, in her, yea so neere vnto her as shee is
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:104174:56"/> to herselfe; (as hath beene said) yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this remayning by ones-selfe in that nakednesse, nudation, and abstrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from all created things, and internall Quietnesse, and rest; introuersion, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation; is to one who is not heerewith quaynted a Thing so new, and strang: as sea nauigation to one that neuer saw sea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. It is at the first some what strang vnto Him to leaue, and depart from the Land his proper Element wherin Hee hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto dwelt, and beene brought vpp, and to committ himselfe to the sea wherewith hee is not acquaynted, and where hee sees no way, or signe to find the way, or hath any firmenesse: but is subiect to a continuall inconstancy of Mouing Waters, and must stand to the Mercy of the Wynd, and waues. Which vnto Him is a great going forth, and mortifying of Humayn inclinations which very vnwillingly depart from their owne way, to commit, and trust themselues to that which they know not, and is wholy aboue their Powre, and Prudence.</p>
               <p>Thus must the soule also follow in this way to <hi>God</hi> a seafayring Man, and leaue all creatures, and her proper will, sense, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wres, and Affections, and her nature who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: wherin hitherto she hath dwelt with certaynty, and beene brought vpp. And through a continuall Abstraction, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from all created things, and anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication

               <p>Like therefor as the Mariner doth tak the certaynty, and knowledg which hee hath of his way in the sea by three signes; either <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> by the compasse by which hee can discerne continually in what Quarter of the world Hee is, the needle alwayes poynting out the North Pole.

               <p>This Inclynation, or internall sparke is not amisse compared by some to the needle in the sea Card, which the seafayring man makes vse of to know in what Quarter hee is. For as that wheresoeuer it is placed tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth its poynt alwayes towards the North Pole through a hidden, and secret virtue being touched with a Loadstone which as it is most commonly found in the North so itt continually moueth the Needle thither. In the same maner the mynd of Man being naked of all Creatures, and once carryed in solitude, and retyrednesse into its origin, and first beginning; it alwayes inclynes that way euen in the midst of Busynesse, and multiplicity of externall occasions. And in this must the soule putt her Trust, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; for the more forceable shee percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues this Inclynation to be; the more eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent signe it is of her progresse in her exercise to <hi>God.</hi> And shee must be very ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refull, and take good heed that shee do not through too much solicitude, working, and multiplicity on her Part extinguish this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clynation.

               <p>But our Intention heere is not properly to shew at lardge, and to teach how wee are to obtayn this Purity, and preparation to <hi>God.</hi> For, for as much as concernes this wee send the soule to other Bookes which aboundantly treat of this matter. Wee will only expressely demonstrate, and declare what manner of preparation there must go before in that soule which is to find the <hi>Kingdome of God</hi> in Her. And afterwards to shew how that when the soule is thus prepared, <hi>God</hi> doth stretch forth his helping hand, and eleuates the soule aboue herselfe vnto <hi>Him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In breife y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> we say with the holy Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, that, that preparation which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the soule to become the <hi>kingdome of God</hi> (which is Mans perfection in this life, as hath beene said) must reach to a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Death, and Annihilation, and is not in its full Perfection, and Hight, vntill the soule haue obtayned her <hi>nothing,</hi> and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall <hi>Death.</hi> And truly as to come hecraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the <hi>Kingdome of God,</hi> it is necessary that a man dye before, being that <hi>Christ</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe died before Hee entred into his <hi>kingdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me</hi> so to come to the <hi>kingdome of God</hi> which is in our soule, Death ought to proceed, to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:104174:63"/> wit, <hi>Spirituall,</hi> by which a Man dyeth, and is annihilated to all that which Hee vniustly vsurped; when Hee was forced to leaue the <hi>Kingdome of God</hi> wherin Hee was first crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and constituted which doth well agree with that which wee before shewed: to wit, that the soule must be eleuated aboue herselfe to attayn to <hi>God.</hi> For as shee must come aboue herselfe, so must shee be in herselfe wholy annihilated. For it is not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that one thing can be at once aboue, and below.</p>
               <p>But before wee treat in particular of the parts which comprehend this <hi>death,</hi> and <hi>Nothing.</hi> Lett vs first declare that they are not to be vnderstood essentially, as though the soule must loose her owne Being, and Creation, or dy according to them. But ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectiuely, and supposedly, to witt, after such a Spiritual maner that the soule be so perfectly auerted, and abstracted from all Creatures, and herselfe (for as much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns affection) and so erected out of pure Loue to <hi>God</hi> that shee forgett all Creatures, and Herselfe, as though they were not: in such wise, that conuerting Herselfe to <hi>God</hi> shee haue not the least impression, or Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of herselfe, or any other thing; as if they were not at All.</p>
               <p>This kynd of <hi>nothing,</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> is the last preparation by which the soule is anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated in herselfe, and eleuated aboue her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe

For that which shee feeles in Herselfe being thus dead, and annihilated, and eleuated aboue herselfe, and all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, can be nothing else but <hi>God</hi> Himselfe. From whence it also followeth that this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>presence</hi> of <hi>God</hi> wherin wee place Mans felicity in this life, and tearme the <hi>Kingdome of God</hi> vppon Earth; cannot be otherwise obtayned but wholy, and Total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not by Parts, and Parcells. True it is, the soule may obtayn this necessary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration by little, and little, but <hi>God</hi> doth not shew himselfe in Her after this perfect maner before this preparation (which is the <hi>Nothing,</hi> and the <hi>Death</hi>) be in its full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. For this <hi>Nothing,</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> haue no degrees. Water may be neither Hott, nor cold, and y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> it is said to be Luke warme; the wall halfe white, and halfe black mixt, and y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> it is called grey, and so forth; but if a Man be aliue, Hee cannot be said to be Dead; and if any thing be some thing, it is not properly tearmed nothing.</p>
               <p>Besydes, being that the presence of <hi>God</hi> heere exhibited to the soule (wherin as is sayd consisteth the Perfection of the soule)
<pb facs="tcp:104174:64"/> is wholy deuyne, it cannot be parted, and deuided. For where <hi>God</hi> is, hee is whole, and entyre. From whence it followeth that the soule through this <hi>Nothing,</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> cannot haue <hi>God</hi> otherwise present y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, entyre, and vnmixt with any Creature. And this is to be well obserued. The soule after this maner may well possesse <hi>God</hi> in greater, or lesse light, as heerafter shall be shewed; yet notwithstanding shee hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any thing, but <hi>God,</hi> whyle shee hath <hi>God.</hi> For as then shee cannot be in the least maner conuerted to any image, but instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shee wholy looseth <hi>God.</hi> Which neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse is not to be vnderstood as though the soule must be perpetually without all incly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, commotions, and feelings. For so no Man in this world would euer find <hi>God</hi> truely. But is sufficient that shee according to her free-will be so perfectly separated from all Creatures, and herselfe that shee is contented that for Eternity shee should neuer think, or reflect vppon them any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, (if so it pleased <hi>God</hi>) euen as though in verity they were not at All.

For it is to be vnderstood generally of All; so that One retayn no propryety, or desyre to any Thing that hee would not willingly forsake for <hi>God:</hi> when
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:104174:75"/> any such occasion is offered. In so much that euen those Things which necessity requires, hee ought to vse without all Propriety, and be contented to be depriued of the same, yea willingly to suffer himselfe to perish through want of them, if so be, it were <hi>Gods,</hi> pleasure, and holy <hi>will. Secondly</hi> by reason <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of the Affection according to which they must be, from the very Bottom of the Hart.

               <p>But it is much easier to shew vnto the sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le that shee must leaue all Creatures with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her to come to <hi>God.</hi> y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> to make her to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:104174:75"/> know whither shee retayn any Affection<note place="margin">Iere. 17.</note> to Creatures in her. For the <hi>Hart of Man is inscrutable, or vnsearcheable, and hard to be known</hi> euen to Man himselfe. Principally his Affection of Loue which is the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior, and secret powre conuerting itselfe, and adhering very couertly to that which is pleasing; and most of all when as the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall corrupted Inclynation doth affect any Thing which is against the Spirit for y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> shee very craftyly couers, and maskes it, least shee should be depriued thereof. And the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore many Spirituall Men deceiue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues who think they haue renounced, and left all for <hi>God:</hi> whereas notwithstanding in very Truth they be possessed within with many Creatures in their fund which they know not of, or if they know, they little reguard, as of small Importance, or that the Affection which they beare vnto Them see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes vnto Them not to be bad, or vndecent, whereas neuerthelesse it is really in itselfe sensuall.</p>
               <p>And truly as long as a Man is not wholy <hi>naked</hi> of all Propriety to externall Things, and altogether confident of corporall neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sityes: It is hard to be discerned whither Hee cleaue, or adhere not somewhere inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinately. For oftentymes vnder shew of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity lurketh affection, and Propriety which is also vnknown to the Party Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe vntill such Tyme as Hee can perfectly

For this sollicitousness, or working cannot be without humayn affection (or at least<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise will be needless) and therefor must of necessity for that present make an impressiō in his Mynd, and mediate betweene <hi>God,</hi> and the soule.</p>
               <p>But becaus it is very vncertayn whither one hath this pure conuersion to <hi>God</hi> and that wee heere properly speake of such as actually haue it not but would gladly attayn to it. Lett Nobody be confident heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but lett each one conuert Him to

Yea also cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall necessaryes, albeit hee knew that the vse, and possession of them could not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, nor were displeasing to <hi>God.</hi> Only becaus hee knoweth well that a truely na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and an exinanited life in itselfe is more conuenient for a seruant of <hi>God,</hi> and more conformable to Chryst. And thus farr hee ought to come to be assured of his Ground.</p>
               <p>And if hee haue vtterly renounced all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Things, &amp; adheres to no exterior Thing but solely loues <hi>God.</hi> Hee will there hold himselfe well contented. Yea will fynd in Himselfe also an Inclynation to it with ioy of Hart. And obserue that whensoeuer Hee by Himselfe makes this Abnegation, Hee actually perceiues in Himselfe an informe, &amp; Empty Mynd of all created things.

For out of these
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:104174:77"/> Affections hee may gather the ground of his hart. As S. Bernard teacheth. Agayn hee must consider how hee hath behaued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe being depriued of Things which hee actually vsed, and possessed; for that which with <hi>God</hi> wee possessed, wee can leaue with ioy. So affirmeth a certayn Spirituall Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher giuing 3. Signes whereby to know whither wee do not adhere inordinately to those exterior Things which wee possesse. <hi>First</hi> (saith hee) if a Man of all his goods <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> take no more y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> necessity requyreth as th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough hee had begged them from doore, to doore, and were alwayes to begg them so. <hi>Secondly</hi> if hee did know that Another had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> need of his goods, and that it were expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient that hee should make as free vse the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof for his necessity, as himselfe: that hee could be as well contented, and wish as well to the other, as to himselfe. <hi>Thirdly</hi> in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> case hee lost them, that hee could be as quiet in his Mynd, and <hi>will:</hi> as though hee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer had had them. Out of these, and such like sygns, a Man may learn to know the hidden grounds of his hart, and Morcouer to esteeme smal things great; for nothing ought to be deemed small which doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue, or hinder vs from <hi>God</hi> in our soule. And the better to declare all that which hath beene said. Take for example a Bird which is tyed fast to the ground, or some bough as-long as shee remaynes tyed her
<pb facs="tcp:104174:78"/> wings serues her to little purpose to lift her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe by them into the Ayr. And it maketh no matter wherewith she be tyed whither with a strong Cord, or with a Thread; yea although it were with a straw as, long as shee remayneth bound; it keepes her below, and hindreth that shee cannot fly vpon high only This difference there is that the longer the Cord is wherewith shee is tyed the higher shee can lift herselfe, yet no higher y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> the Cord will giue her leaue. Neither doth shee obserue that shee is bound but by flying vp: for y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> shee sees how, and where shee is fast.</p>
               <p>Thus it is also with the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Man wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ich of its own nature hath no communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with these inferior Things, and is crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Liue in <hi>God,</hi> as a Byrd in the Ayr; but in this, is hindered through the Affection to Creatures For this bynds it fast to the earth; how little soeuer the Things be which the soule doth affect. Althought it were but the least mispent Tyme with Affection; the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> is thereby held vnder, and hindred that it cannot eleuate itselfe into <hi>God.</hi> Only this Difference there is; that the lesse inordinate the Affection is, the neerer the <hi>Spirit</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth to <hi>God.</hi> Yet can hee neuer Eleuate himselfe perfectly into <hi>God,</hi> but is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually drawn backe till such Tyme, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

                  <hi>that pouerty should be blissed. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, Truth doth affirme it, who neither doth deceiue, or can be deceiued. Blissed are the poore of Spirit. How come you therefore o foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Childeren of Adam to seeke after Riches, to desyre wealth: considering the blissednesse of the Poore is auouched by God, commended to the world, and beleiued by Men? Lett a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>athen seeke Them, who liueth without God.
<pb facs="tcp:104174:79"/> Lett a Iew desyre, Them who hath receiued temporall Promises; but with what Face, or rather with what hart can a Christian seeke for Riches being Christ hath pronounced the Poore to be blissed, and hath threatned the Rich with a wooe. Saying wooe to you that are rich.</hi> Which words doe cleerely shew how necessary is the perfect Abnegation, and Renunciation of all created Things. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a man ought to endeauour constantly, and apply himselfe seriously therevnto. And now when hee perceiues in himselfe that his Free-will is willing to yeild itselfe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all created things: hee must often stirr vpp this affection in him to become thr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oughly Poor, and abnegated for <hi>God:</hi> and lett him keepe himselfe as long as possible hee can, and dilate his hart heerin. For this will make him depart from all exterior things, and so come to himselfe, and make him <hi>naked,</hi> &amp; free from all impressions, Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and affections; and able to be eleuated in <hi>Spirit</hi> to <hi>God</hi> as heerafter shall be taught. And so much the more, better, easier, and perfecter by how much the more entyrely, and absolutly, hee hath forsaken all created Things, and is estranged from them, euen with his inferior sensible Affections which hee must endeauour to abstract from them, as much, as is possible. For although one may persist therewith before <hi>God</hi> hauing for his Loue renounced all created things with his
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:104174:80"/> free-will (the sensible Part remayning yet somewhat affected vnto them: becaus Hee hath not this, in his Powre) neuertheless that internall Rest, and enioying of <hi>God</hi> is therewith hindered through the vnquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and commotion which the inferior Part stirreth vp in the soule.</p>
               <p>And therefor a Man must endeauour with all possible ioy of Hart to performe this Abnegation. For so Hee draweth the Inferior Part wholy vnto Him which in None of the Other Poynts is so requisit as in this. Becaus the soule through the adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Affection to any Creature is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of <hi>God</hi> y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> through defect of any of the ensuing Poynts: so that this ought to be in a most perfect manner in him who desy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to obtayn <hi>God.</hi> And truly hee is farr from the Spirituall <hi>Death,</hi> and Annihilatiō (which is exacted of a Contemplatiue sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le) who possesseth any thing with Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty out of <hi>God.</hi> For as S. Cyprian sayth. <hi>Euen as myne eyes cannot behold Heauen, and earth both at Once, so the Loue of God, and the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue of the world cannot be Both together in the soule.</hi> And therefor no Man is fitt for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating of deuyne, and heauenly Things but Hee who is Poore (according to the Affection) in all temporall Things.</p>

               <p>SECONDLY to come to <hi>God</hi> the soule must also deny, and relinquish her ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne-self. This S.

And like, as the soule is, and resteth out of herselfe when shee adhereth to any exterior creature; so is shee also vnder her-selfe, when as by inordinate loue shee is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clyned, and bent to the commodyties, and pleasures of the body and remayneth in her selfe when as with complacence, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety shee resteth in her proper <hi>will,</hi> iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement, or worke, or otherwise loueth, or affecteth her selfe inordinately. For as S. Dyonisius saith. <hi>Loue is an vniting powre, and doth subiect, incline, and vnite as much as it can the louer with the beloued, whatsoeuer it be</hi> And therefor it subiecteth also the soule to her-selfe when shee loueth her-selfe for her-selfe; which selfe-loue when shee relinquisheth, and abnegateth shee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:104174:81"/> free from her-selfe, as shee is also loose, and free from all externall creatures by forsakeing, and renouncing them.</p>
               <p>But because y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> being no more in her-selfe shee must of necessity rest, and remayne else-where.

So y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> as by this, shee is so free, and <hi>naked</hi> from all creatures, as though they were not at all. In like manner by y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> resignation shee becometh so alienated, and free from her selfe, as though shee were no more. Wherernto it is needfull y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> shee vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly forsake all propriety like as shee must leaue wholy, and abnegate all manner of adhesion to exterior creatures. But in this perfect resignation consists much more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and also deceit, y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> in the former abne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiō.

And when hee is denyed that which hee hath a desyr to; hee becomes melancholy, and out of order; which is an euydent sign of selfe-loue: that in all things seekes her owne end, confort, &amp; commodity either exterior, or interior: &amp; this through an inbred, &amp; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall inclynation of the soule to herselfe▪ For selfe-loue which was inordinately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted to the body is by the precedent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation in a manner extinguished in her,

Which is an euident sign of selfe-loue. Besides hee shall perceiue that in his Conuersion to <hi>God</hi> hee is alwayes effigiated with himselfe, or alwayes looking on himself, and that very grossely.

               <p>THE soule which is now freed as hath been said from all Creatures, herself, and also from <hi>Gods</hi> guifts, may yet rest, and liue in <hi>something.</hi> It is incredible to such as haue not experienced the same howcraftyly, and couertly nature seekes itselfe, and what shifts shee vseth before shee will be brought to this <hi>Death.</hi> But it is not to be much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at in her, neither is shee much to be blamed for it, for euery thing imployes all its forces to conserue the Being, and life itt hath receiued from <hi>God,</hi> and vseth all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in resisting that which might occasiō the losse thereof, since it hath no other good besydes itt.

For shee cannot, as hath beene said be partly vnder, and in her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and partly aboue herself; nor half dead, nor halfe aliue; And therefor though she be much neerer to <hi>God</hi> hauing only this last impediment in Her y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> shee was when shee had all the former: notwithstanding shee remayning thus, can no more be carryed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>God</hi> y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> remayning in the foresaid Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions without her, or within her.

               <p>We haue compared the Contents of these Points to a sea.

For the Images be often so subtile that they seeme to them not to be Images: yea it is scarse possible for them to beleine it till such tyme as they actually be denudated of the same. And nature frames these secret Images of <hi>God</hi> of purpose not to come to <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked faith</hi> which shee extrermely abhorreth.

               <p>Now shee is not yet capable of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyn help, becaus the former preparation in her is too operatiue, and gros by reason of the Multiplicity of the foresaid Poynts th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough which shee stands yet in herself.

Which sequestration, and Annihilation must of necessity preceed before the soule can come without <hi>Medium</hi> or meane to <hi>God</hi> (as shall heerafter more clearely appeare) and this annihilation cannot be otherwise obtayned y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> after this manner; in keeping ones-self separated from all adhesion, and formes of Creatures by an internall vacancy; and ceasing from all working: excepting that which is needfull to retayn this simple, and vniforme Mynd whereof wee meane to treate yet more particularly.</p>
               <p>For the Man whom wee heer describe is inwardly disposed like vnto water which is mingled with Earth which being obscure, and darke; is vnapt to receiue into it the light of the Sunn that shyneth vppon itt; from which obscurity itt cannot be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by any other Meanes y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> by standing still: for so itt becomes cleare in itselfe, the earth with which it was mingled sinking downe into the Bottome, and the water remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

Neuertheles in such an one in whom by the precedent preparation the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the senses (wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ich in vnexercised Men are mingled, &amp; clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue together) are wholy separated the one from the other according to the free-will. In which holy <hi>Rest</hi> the Natures, and senses [which are corporall, and earthly] being loose, and vacant from all adhesion, and working sink down of themselues; and the <hi>Spirit</hi> also ascends aboue where its proper place is which of its owne nature is cleare, and apt to receiue the <hi>deuyn light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though this Clarity might in some discreet sort by working be produced in the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:104174:108"/> soule, yet the <hi>Spirit</hi> would for the most part thereby be more mingled with nature, and breed more obscurity in the soule like as water mingled with Earth by stirring can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ordinarily be made cleere, but more, &amp; more troubled. And therefor all operations which do not discreetly serue to perseuer the better in this internall peace must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected by the soule. But the soule being thus recollected will in the beginning in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man suffer a great conflict of the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and powres which will not permitt themselues to be in this manner captiuated by <hi>naked fayth,</hi> but will bring before her Images, and similitudes of <hi>God,</hi> or striue to know, and feele <hi>him</hi> after their grosse ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue manner: and so will often disturbe, and interrupt her internall peace, and soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.

               <p>And in case shee cannot therewith quiet Her rebellious senses, and eschew their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnations; Then shall shee gently renew in herself by a simple recordation, or refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion how that <hi>God</hi> is infinitly eleuated abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:104174:108"/> the more shee endeauours to know, tast, or feele <hi>him</hi> the farther shee strayeth from <hi>him</hi> and shee must so simply lett go all working of her Powres, doing as though shee stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in some great Darkenesse should haue a desyre to see that which is there about her. Such a desyre shee would not much reguard or follow, or would bend her forces to the beholding of them, knowing full well, that it were but lost Labour; But would rather expect with Patience the Light, without which shee can see nothing. So must the soule do likewise suppressing all arising, and working aswell of the vnderstanding, as of the will, and keepe them in such perfect Peace, as through shee actually beheld, and enioyed <hi>God</hi> according to her desyr. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Hee</hi> is as neere vnto Her, as shee is to herselfe, and that shee must not make <hi>Him</hi> present; but <hi>Hee</hi> must make himselfe present vnto her, which <hi>hee</hi> will not do till such tyme as shee hath left all working, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syr, and Election, and is wholy content to enioy <hi>him</hi> at such Tyme, and after such manner as pleaseth <hi>him,</hi> yea if <hi>hee</hi> would hide himself always from her; to be also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed therin.</p>
               <p>And no lesse <hi>Combat</hi> will shee suffer by the manisold euagations of her senses, and in resisting their inclynations to Creatures which will often effigiate, or make Her full of Images, trouble, And auert Her from
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:104174:109"/>
                  <hi>God.</hi> Heere must shee likewise with great symplicity oppose herselfe: not fighting ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ainst the incydent Images, thoughts, or ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing commotions, but eschewing them all,<note place="margin">Sligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the best figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</note> as well as shee can by neglecting them, leau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them where shee found them; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning quietly to herself. To which end itt will helpe her to remember that shee hathin herselfe the Origin of all whatsoeuer shee would seeke, or desire without Her; which shee also can there more perfectly enioy, y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> with out Her.</p>
               <p>And besides this impugnation: or Combat, shee will perceiue another in Her. For shee shall sometymes fynd a sorrow in her by reason that it seemes to her that shee is wholy idle, when as now, and then shee perceiueth in herselfe no particular <hi>light,</hi> or mouing Affection, or the ioy, and louely <hi>Vnity</hi> whereof wee haue spoken. This ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects itselfe in the beginning before the sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le is well practised in this internall Exercise. To this shee must not easyly giue eare; but her work must be diligently to resist all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident thoughts; and thus symply to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to remayn by herselfe. For it is labour enough to keepe her Powres quiet, and continually to eschew working, and to kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe within, that which is continually run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out, and wandering, as is our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and other powres which like to a mill are always turning, and working, and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:104174:109"/> as a flowing water always running out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>And it is not to be beleiued that the soule after the former Abnegation, and resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is presently without all internall Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: albeit shee cannot actually find it out in her. Becaus it is oftentymes very secret, and hidden in her; and since shee is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaynted with these secret operations shee may very well haue the same, and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it. Howsoeuer being shee keepes her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in this manner internally recollected to please <hi>God</hi> in the best manner? and that shee couragiously resisteth all incident ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and commotions intending thereby to prepare, and make a fitt place for <hi>God</hi> not knowing any other better meanes y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> this.

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:104174:110"/> of the former Abnegation, Resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and pure Loue: When the soule per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues herselfe to be thus faln; lett her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the foresaid Acts sett down in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Exercise; but as symply as possibly shee can beginning from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leife of the inward presence of <hi>God</hi> in her. But if the Tepidity, and coldnes proceed from the manifold distractions; shee shall principally renew in herself the Abnegation of all created things; but if it come through meere defect of feruour, and Alacrity shee must hold herselfe most of All in perfect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation, and endeauour to stirr vp in her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the foresaid <hi>spirituall ioy, or at least the spirituall peace, and solitude of her hart.</hi> And that cheifely when shee findeth in herself an irkesomenes of this sequestration, and soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarines.

For as to one that can scarse go, or stand the least thing whereby hee can take hold on, is an helpe vnto him; in like manner the soule which beginneth to withdraw herselfe from Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and to lift herself vp to <hi>God,</hi> is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes holpen in her infirmity by some sma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le exterior meanes. Yet must shee endeauour as much as shee can to diue into herselfe, &amp; in a sinking manner to fall into the hidden presence of <hi>God.</hi> But becaus much depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vppon this present exercise being that it maketh the way to all, that followeth, and is the right <hi>Medium</hi> or meane betwixt that which hath beene said, and that which shall be said; lett vs yet more clearely expres what this internall working of the soule is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the manner of it; that shee may the better know what shee now doth, and be secured from the false Rest whereof shee may seeme heere to suffer some danger.</p>
               <p>The proper working therefor of the sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le in this present exercise is to perfect her Mynd (which through the former Poynts beginneth to be bared of all creatures, and also separated from the senses, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently through the internall deuyne light beginneth to be enlightned) more, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re in this purity; becaus it is the only instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wherewith shee must worke on for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>words.
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:104174:111"/> Which though it must be donne with so great symplicity, and vniformity that the soule is commonly said to be vacant, and meere passiue. Yet if wee rightly consider it wee shall find that diuers internall opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are very laborious, are heere performed on the soules part with much symplicity, and Quiet; and in comparison, and Consideration of the former exterior grosse workings they are not esteemed, and named workings, being so internall, and symple.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And first</hi> there is heere a constant perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in this Internall disposition which the forementioned Poynts produce in the soule. For whereas the soule by them is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to this interior purenesse; it is conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently necessary that shee also perseuer es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially in them; that shee may be able to retayn in Her this deuyn disposition. So that the Auersion from Ceatures, which the absolute Abnegation befor mencioned doth include: also perfect Resignation, Pure-Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, and <hi>naked fayth</hi> are heere constantly exercised by the soule, although symply in an interior Conuersion: which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing requyres no lesse Animaduersion, or obseruation y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> the former poynts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> To continue thus, the soule <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> doth oftentymes through <hi>fayth,</hi> as also thr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough a symple apprehension of her Resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Abnegation out of pure Loue to

                  <hi>God</hi> renew the knowledg of <hi>Gods</hi> presence in Her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly</hi> shee is continually pressing, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> keeping vnder aswell the fantasy, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior <hi>will</hi> which always through their Grossenes do trouble the inward enioying of the hidden <hi>deuyn light.</hi> Besides with great diligence shee also holdeth the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing captiuated in the obscurity of <hi>fayth.</hi> All which operations of the soule are the more Laborious vnto Her, by how much they must be done with greater symplicity and vniformity; and by how much the sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le through her vnexercisednes is stronglier impugned by the senses, and hath lesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne stability; so that all her Labour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in putting away the hinderances; and in retayning of the interne clarity which shee perceiues to be so subtyle that itt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth away vppon the least negligence; which notwithstanding is all her Help, strength, sole obiect, and only stay in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Manifestation. And when shee can conuert herself to that, shee hath little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in holding her Powres captiuated, and shutt vpp; but without itt shee hath nothing else but the propinquity, or neernes therevnto. Wee will declare itt by a simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
               <p>It is in a manner heerin. As if a Man stood vppon the banke-syde of a running water in the Bottome whereof hee should espye a
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:104174:112"/> pretious peice of coyne of which hee had lost the sight the water being troubled, and <hi>leafes</hi> swiming continually aboue the same. This man hauing a desyr to gett the peice of Money would as y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> reguard, or reflect vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon no other Thing y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> to haue his eye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually fixed vppon the place where Hee first saw the Money. And although hee should so remayn a long Tyme without seeing of the same, Hee would not therefor be idle aslong as hee keepes his eye careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vppon the place where the Money lay; that so the water becoming cleere Hee might come to the sight of the Money ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ayn, and gett it. And albeit this Man did not labour neither with hands, or feete, yet neuertheles this would requyre a strict cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tody of the whole Man. So that euen his Thoughts hee must keepe warily by Him, least through them hee come to loose the place where Hee did see the Money.</p>
               <p>Lo this similitude expresseth something of that which passeth in the soule whereof wee now speake, shee is within not vnlike to a water that is very thick, troubled, and always flowing. There, in her former exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise shee perceiued a pretious peice of coyn, a deuyne Beame, or sparke; and therefore hath shee conuerted thither all her sight, and Thoughts; and although shee be often hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered from the sight, and enioying of this hidden, and pretious <hi>Good</hi> by reason of her
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:104174:112"/> obscure, and encombred Ground; neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse shee remayns always conuerted thither expecting still more cleerenesse that shee may behold, and enioy the same ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: which when shee doth; shee is no whit idle; no more then the other Man. Yea much lesse, becaus shee not only conuerts her sight, and ayme interiorly towards the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den spark, like as the other Man doth to the peice of Coyn; but also endeauours conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to quiet, and hold still that running water, and to make cleere her muddy, and troubled Ground which is somewhat in her power, and exacts more work y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> a bare fixed sight. But no comparison can soe clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely expres this interior labour, as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout, and faythfull soule doth experience it in herselfe, who in this pretious <hi>peice</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in her felicity both temporall, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall; hauing already for the gayning heerof giuen all shee hath, is, and can, and neither knowing, or desyring any other <hi>Good</hi> besi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des it. So that although a soule which is not well prepared by the fowr foresaid poynts may oftentymes be feared to remayn in a false interior Rest; when shee placeth her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in this symple thought; Becaus that standing yet in her senses, and nature, and not hauing any certayn interior obiect to which shee can conuert herselfe shee falleth very easyly into an naturall idlenes, and res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth therin; but it is not so with that soule of
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:104174:113"/> whom wee heere speake. Well shee may<note place="margin">not this well.</note> fall from her Interior Recordation, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation but there is no feare that shee will rest in her senses from which she hath an Horrour.</p>

               <p>Therefor like as the corporall sunn stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the firmament sendeth forth his Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes into all parts of the Earth, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicateth his Light generally to all without exception of Persons, or places, or any thing else when it is not hindered by some impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment.

But principally this happeneth in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing, and enioying of the Light which of itself doth exhibitt itself to the eye, yea in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth itself therin according to its being, and vniteth itself therewith to the which the eye cannot turne itself to behold itt for the eye can only turne itself to that which is some distance from itt, and without; but this light is within itt, and vnited to itt, and itt enioyeth the same essentially. And much lesse hath itt need of the help, or coopera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the other senses, or members to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, and enioy the fame. For all that they can do, is but to remoue the impediments which may occur betwixt the eye, and the light which being taken away all other works are superfluous, yea hinder. Thus when wee are in a dark place where the windowes through which the light should come, are shutt; the feet carry the eyes, and the Body to the windowes, and the hands openeth the same: but afterwards they can confer nothing to the receiuing, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying of the light. Also when the light is actually shyning in the eyes the other sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses can take no knowledg thereof, like as
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:104174:119"/> they do of other obiects. Becaus the Light is not palpable, or sensible.</p>
               <p>In the same maner to the receiuing of this <hi>deuyne light</hi> in the soule.

For that <hi>Light</hi> must enter in of itself; nor is it necessary by any operation of the soule to be made present, yea to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to make that present is to stopp the way by which itt must come into the soule, and when it is actually in the soule the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res can no more turne themselues to itt to take notice thereof, or to retayn itt in the soule y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> the hands can feele, and apprehend the light.

Therefore the soule shall reflect se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously on this Poynt, and Imitate the blynd Man that neuer saw light in his life who hauing a great desyr to see itt cannot with hold his fantasy, but that itt will by reason of this internall desyr frame many formes, and similitudes thereof though farr from the true Condition of the light which is such, as it cannot be known, but only by

               <p>But in case the soule (notwithstanding this Doctryn) do perceiue no benefitt the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby to herself, and that the senses remayns as Rebellious as before; shee must not for all that loose her couradge: yea shee ought not to trouble herself therefor, but must willin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly, and quietly endure the Conflict in Her, knowing that <hi>God</hi> will not account itt as a fault, but to her greater meritt. And lett her persuade herself that perseuering thus faythfully shee shall in the end obtayn per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Victory ouer these her domesticke ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes keeping them vnder her command, &amp; subiection.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus that albeit the Powres, and senses do now no more hinder through their foresaid operations: Neuertheles they do not hold vp all alike, neither doth their working perfectly cease from the beginning; being it is vsuall to them, and contrary to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Inclination to remayn so vacant, and quiet, and therefore the soules dares not place her confidence therin, and much lesse can shee so wholy, and symply display, and open herself as is needfull to receiue, and retayn the <hi>deuyne Light.</hi> For that must be done wholy passiuely: which most of all happens through want of <hi>naked fayth,</hi> and also pure Loue, or for practise in them.</p>
               <p>For although Abnegation, and Resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in such-wise as heeretofore hath beene declared be in this soule; neuertheles the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked fayth,</hi> and pure Loue cannot be in Her in their full perfection.

Whereas notwithstanding shee seeth that it is essentially always the same; and is always a like ready to infuse itselfe into her: from whence shee may easyly gather that shee hath some hidden defects in herself which do hinder this <hi>Light,</hi> and obseruing the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me shee endeauours by little, and little to apply herselfe to more purity, and sympli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; and forsake all former Certaynty, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revppon shee yet rested, and confided; and now relyes wholy vppon <hi>God;</hi> and so co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes at last, that standing in due preparation, and capablenes of this <hi>deuyne light</hi> shee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth the same essentially in Her in its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Clarity. But to expres yet cleerer how this heauenly <hi>Light</hi> first cometh into the soule which neuer before experienced the same, and how by little, and little it infuseth itself more copiously into Her vntill at lēgth hauing gotten a free entrance into Her itt doth wholy perlustrate, and illuminate Her. Lett vs agayn resume the comparison of our corporall eyes, and of this Externall
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:104174:122"/> light of the sunn. And obserue how one being borne blynd might come to behold, and enioy this externall Light.</p>
               <p>Take y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> a Man borne blynd, not so that his sight within Him is wholy out, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus Hee hath a thicke skinne vppon his eyes which Hee brought with Him into the world, which hindereth him from seeing the Light of the sunn. This Man if perchance He light of an Expert Maister who taketh in hand to make Him see, Hee will not do it out of hand, neither shall hee receiue his sight presently, but by little, and little. First when the skin is worne partly of, Hee will beginn to perceiue in his eyes the presence, and some glimps of the Light, and thereby will know Himselfe to be in the light, which notwithstanding Hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not as yet behold, but only will enioy some small beames thereof which sueetly infuse themselues into his eyes, and will engender in Him a great desyr to behold, and enioy that pleasant light cleerly. And obserue: that Hee shall not behold these lightsome bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes clearely, nor conuert himselfe operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely vnto them (becaus that is not in his Powre) but receiue them in Him passiuely, and thereby in some sort come to know the Nature, and Condition of the Light which before was vnknown vnto Him. By that little glimps also of Light his eyes are prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and made fitt by little, and little to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:104174:123"/> the light in its perfect clearenes. For although hee were ridd of the skinn all at once, yet neuertheles his sight would be too weake at the first to behold the cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes thereof; and would soone feele payn in his eyes not being accustomed to be in the clearenes of the Light. This wee obserue in ourselues when as wee suddenly come out of a darke place into some great light. For wee y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> presently feele in our eyes a payne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnes, and an vnaptnes to see well: which more, and more passeth away when our eyes are a little accustomed to the Light. How much the more must this be, in the eyes of Him who did neuer see light before?

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:104174:123"/> with his eyes the Light clearely. But if the Cure succeed prosperously, and that at length Hee be wholy freed from the former thick skin, and his eyes restored to their perfect cleerenes, so that Hee can receiue, the light into them without difficulty: And that they are strengthned, and Beginn to behold, and enioy the pleasant light in itts clearenes at all tymes, and places without Labour, &amp; difficulty, and all things in the same. Hee will much wonder that being before Hee was so compassed about with the Light, yet could conceiue nothing thereof; seeing now playnly that the sault was not in the <hi>light,</hi> but in the blyndnes of his eyes. And y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> Hee needs no further instruction how Hee shall apply his eyes towards the light to behold, and enioy the same.</p>
               <p>Behold thus it happeneth with the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior eye, and with the receiuing of the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyne Light</hi> into the soule; which is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in its perfect Clearenes all at once, but by degrees.

And albeit that by the Sacrament of Confession his synns were taken away, neuertheles the thick skinns are not taken away from his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior eyes, nor can the <hi>Spirit</hi> therefor behold the <hi>deuyne Light;</hi> Becaus there still remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the root of synn: selfe-loue, and vnbrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Passions, and Affections. These are all skinns vppon the Interior eyes of the soule, and do mediate betwixt Her, and <hi>God,</hi> but when as Man applyeth Himself to a purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue life mortifying his vnbridled Affections and euill inclynations, these skinns beginn to weare away from his interior eyes, and going by degrees forward, and coming to an absolute Abnegation of all Creatures, &amp; a perfect Resignation of Himself, and a pure Loue, and <hi>naked Fayth,</hi> and exercising him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe diligently heerin as hath beene said; y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> the skinns begin to fall of from his Interior eyes, and all that did mediate betwixt <hi>Him,</hi> and <hi>God.</hi>

               <p>This Inclynation S. Augustyn calleth (<hi>pondus Animae) the poise, or weight of the soule. My Loue</hi> (saith Hee) <hi>is my Poyse, and thither am I carried whither my Loue swayeth.</hi> The soules proper resting Place is where that is, which it Loueth, and thither is shee carryed by Loue, like as a stone to the earth by its weight. This Inclynation (as S. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas of Aquyne sayth) is that which first moues itself amongst the powres of the soule, and therefore is moued of itself with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out other help.</p>
               <p>This Interior Powr is loose, and separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the soule of which wee now speake. For shee hath sequestred, and freed herself from all inordinate Loue, and adhering to Creatures; and therefore shee very easily perceiueth this in Her, after that shee hath actually obtayned in Her, by the former Exercise the Abnegation, and Resignation mentioned. For thereby this Louing <hi>powr</hi> which before was spread diuersely amongst Creatures is wholy vnited, and recollected in itself. And becaus the soule hath conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:104174:127"/> her Affection, and Loue to <hi>God:</hi> conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently this inclynation of the Louing Powr is very subtile, noble, and deuyne. And this <hi>deuyne sparke</hi> must the soule en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour to obtayn wholy into her Powr; for it is the Instrument wherewith shee is to eleuate herselfe to <hi>God,</hi> and be absorpt in <hi>Him</hi> as heerafter shall be taught.</p>
               <p>But becaus the soule hath not, as yet hee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re entrance into <hi>God,</hi> and standing only in <hi>naked fayth:</hi> that Hee is intimately present vnto Her; hence is this Louing Powr incly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning very symply without ceasing to the <hi>hidden Good</hi> which it solely Loueth; when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer it is not hindered through some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering, or working of the soule. And this inclynation is no worke of hers produced of sett purpose, but a naturall flowing, and Propension; yet such as the soule can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert herself vnto, and reflect vppon; yea such as shee may vse as a <hi>deuyne Aspiration</hi> to <hi>God.</hi> And as-long, as shee is not wholy resigned in <hi>Him,</hi> or hath <hi>Him</hi> through <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked fayth</hi> so intimately present, as when shee is perfectly resigned, and thereby internally disposed towards <hi>God,</hi> as hath beene said; this internall Inclination of Hart serues for a symple apprehension, and recordation of <hi>God</hi> as often as shee will obserue it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect therevppon For after that shee is who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resigned in <hi>God,</hi> and adhereth interiorly to Him by <hi>naked fayth.</hi> This Inclynation
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:104174:128"/> doth no more driue the soule outwardly, but drawes her inwardly to repose in <hi>Him;</hi> whom shee intymly Loueth for himself. For shee is inwardly there where <hi>God</hi> is present without <hi>Medium,</hi> or meane. And being that shee on her Part hath no Image, or similitude, This serues her for a sign of <hi>Gods</hi> presence. Yea, and for as much, as the soules proper resting Place, and Center is in <hi>God.</hi> And that shee hath a continuall, and naturall Inclynation to <hi>Him</hi> which can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be satisfyed out of <hi>Him;</hi> wee cannot as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume any Thing more proper y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> this Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Inclynation. Which when-soeuer a man is wholy free, and vacant of all Creatures, doth admonish <hi>Him</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and inclynes Him vnto <hi>Him</hi> as to his proper resting Place.</p>
               <p>Behold when the soule doth with suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient symplicity conuert herself to this inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Inclynation, shee can perseuer very well in this denudation, and vacancy of her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and continue in receiuing that <hi>deuyne Light.</hi> Wherefore standing in a nakednes from all Creatures, and Vacancy <hi>of her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per working,</hi> and being wholy resigned in <hi>God</hi> shee shall symply sink down into her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and will presently perceiue this incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation which shee must suffer in Her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing any thing to make the same clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, or more intimate, or Nobler. For the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby shee would make it to Become wholy
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:104174:128"/> grosse, and Naturall, and obscure that <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyne light</hi> in Her. Shee may well, yea must by a symple inward Conuersion to the same perseuer in enioying the inflowing Beames of the <hi>deuyne light</hi> in Her (as hath beene said) But that this Inclynation may be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyne,</hi> and serue her for a Recordation of <hi>God</hi> the least work may not be admitted as caused, or brought forth by the soule; But must be in a perfect vacancy, and Quietnes of the Exterior, and Interior Man passiuely receiued. So that the soule herself may not conuert herself vnto it but with shutt eyes. For heere shee is but in herself, and not aboue herself; neuertheles shee resteth not in herself, But is inclyning out of Nature into the <hi>Spiritt,</hi> out of tyme, into Eternity; and doth obserue neither Tyme, Place, nor her owne Image, but sleightly, and vacant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For shee is wholy free, and separated from them; although by reason of her weakens not wholy auerted from them, nor eleuated aboue them. And by how much the soule doth keepe herself quiet, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant externally, and internally; so much the more noble, and <hi>deuyne</hi> doth this Inclyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shew itself, and the <hi>deuyne light</hi> more cleerely illuminate Her. And so the soule by meanes of this inclynation may continue receiuing, and vsing these Beames wherof wee haue spoken in the precedent Chapter.</p>
               <p>By meanes of this <hi>Inclynation</hi> the soule
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:104174:129"/> may also after Another maner perseuer in theforesaid Nakednes, and Vacancy, and vse of the <hi>deuyne light,</hi> with more satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and greater progres. For as shee can take this Inclynation descending downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards into her-selfe where her proper pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce is; and there hold herselfe by it, as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of <hi>God.</hi> So can shee like wise vse the same thereby to eleuate herself vpwards to the <hi>deuyne Light</hi> to receiue the same in her with greater fullnes, and Clarity. For by this <hi>Inclynation</hi> shee is bowed downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in herself, and there very sparingly perceiueth this <hi>Light.</hi> But this eleuation must also be done with great symplicity on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by meanes of the foresaid introuerted Louing Powr, which as it was mouing her Interiorly to that noble hidden <hi>Light,</hi> so now is it eleuating her to the same, not to continue in this eleuation, which as yet shee is not able to do. And shee hath also sufficiently found by experience that shee cannot continue introuerted, and raised to the <hi>light</hi> which is so intimate present vnto her; but only to cast herself swiftly into it for a moment. Shee doth as one that will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the sunn in its owne sphere who swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly casting his eyes vppon the cleare shyning sunn withdraweth them presently agayn, &amp; shutts them too, not being able to looke vppon it, but for a Moment: in which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding Moment of tyme Hee sees, &amp;
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:104174:129"/> knowes the sunn which Hee is not able to behold fixedly. In like maner the soule wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lch is no wayes able to behold stedfastly the <hi>deuyne light,</hi> Nor to conuert herself with Continuance vnto it; can only by a swift, and short Conuersion (as hath beene said) cast herself in to it; by which shee is separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from herself, &amp; all Creatures, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the <hi>deuyne light</hi> with more Clarity, &amp; perfection in Her, and is thereby carryed further into <hi>God,</hi> y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> shee was by the former inclynation. Which swift Conuersion the soule so often reneweth in herself, as shee perceiueth herself to be swarued, and sunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down to the senses; and that the <hi>deuyne light</hi> in her decayeth; and euery Tyme shee dilates her-self to the vttermost extent of her powr in the said <hi>Light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this maner is farr different from the precedent according to the diuers disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the soule, who must heerin carry herself wholy otherwise; not so much passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely, as actiuely, neuertheles continually in requisit symplicity. And to this maner the deuout soule shall stirr vp herself when as shee fyndeth herself to haue gotten some Maystry of the foresaid inclination. And by how much the more symply the soule per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth this swift Conuersion so much the clearer doth this <hi>deuyne light</hi> shine in her. Yea sometymes also when shee actuateth this swift Conuersion liuely enough, shee
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:104174:130"/> penetrates herself, and discouers the <hi>deuyne presence</hi> in Her. And therefore this internall Exercise may not only be called a recorda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or mynding of <hi>God,</hi> but also an adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to <hi>God.</hi> For Albeit that the <hi>Spirit</hi> is not stedfastly conuerted into that <hi>deuyne light,</hi> nor cōsequently into <hi>God:</hi> yet neuertheles to the vttermost of its Powr it doth extend it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to that <hi>deuyne light,</hi> and by the same doth cleaue, and adhere to <hi>God.</hi> And thr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough this secret, and internall Meanes the soule perseuers in that swift, and short con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion to that <hi>Light</hi> wherof wee haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the former Chapter. Besides these two ways, there is None by which the soule can nakedly Continue in the vsing of the <hi>internall light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefor shee must endeauour to haue them in Her that thereby shee may without obstacle stedfastly receiue this <hi>deuyne light,</hi> Whensoeuer shee is touched to the denuda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Creatures, and internall vacancy of her Powrs; And hath therin by the foresaid Exercises gotten some hold, y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> must shee leaue her internall working principally that of beholding; and suffer herselfe instantly to slipp symply into that hidden increated <hi>good</hi> which is most intimate present vnto Her, firmely beleiuing that shee shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by the same when as shee resigns herself entirely vnto it. And at the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant shee shall perceiue the foresaid Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:104174:130"/> which albeit at the first seemeth to be grosse, and wholy naturall; shee must not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding stay by the same, and it will by little, and little become more subtyle, noble, and <hi>deuyne.</hi> To wit, by how much the soule more nakedly, and purely resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gneth herself to <hi>God;</hi> so that very little of her own work will be therin. And hauing that <hi>Inclynation</hi> so in some sort in her powr shee shall also endeauour thereby to eleuate herself to that <hi>deuyne light</hi> after the foresaid maner. And if shee apply herself constantly<note place="margin">Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the best tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher.</note> to this (as now is said) shee will fynd by Experience all that is said, more cleerely y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> can by words be expressed vnto her. For it is not well possible to declare fully by words the interior disposition of the soule in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of this <hi>Interior Light.</hi> Only wee haue to our possibility exhibited to the deuout soule that being now arriued to the interior Nakednes, and Emptynes shee should not presently eleuate herself to the Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>deuyne presence,</hi> as commonly it happeneth; for thereby shee would much hinder herself, and scars euer attayn there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto. For this Internall preparation must necessarily preceed before shee be fitt to be eleuated aboue herself to the Contemplation of <hi>God,</hi> as hath beene said.</p>
               <p>And for want of right distinguishing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wixt this <hi>deuyne light, and deuyne presence</hi> many remayn all their life long standing at
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:104174:131"/> the doore without euer entring into <hi>God▪</hi> For assoon as they perceiue by the former <hi>interior disposition</hi> the Manifestation of the <hi>deuyne Light</hi> in Them, they presently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert themselues to itt, and behold it as <hi>God,</hi> by which so doing they make of a superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall <hi>Light,</hi> a Naturall; and so neuer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn <hi>God</hi> deuynely in them. Yea they neuer haue that <hi>deuyne light</hi> in its purity, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenes, Becaus they conuert themselues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it to contemplate the same whereby they take all excellency away from it. And hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce it is, that they also remayn in themselues without progres. Whereas on the contrary, if they did receiue the arriseing <hi>light</hi> passiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in them, and suffered themselues to be prepared by it: they would after a most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and certayn maner be eleuated to the Contemplation of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the reason why they do not suffer themselues in such wise to be prepared by that <hi>interior Light,</hi> Is principally becaus it seemeth to them too symple after such ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner passiuely to receiue that <hi>Light,</hi> and to vse the foresaid meanes. They perswade themselues they ought to do more, and to make vse of the <hi>Light</hi> in a more full, and perfect maner; whereby they do as one who would go runn to meete the vprising sunn, and in the meane while should fall into a dark Pitt where Hee would not be able to behold, and enioy the sunn euen
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:104174:131"/> when it is Risen. For endeauouring to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, and further in themselues the arising <hi>Light.</hi> They cast an impediment by their grosse working. They ought therefor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning in their internall peace, and quiet disposition to expect vntill such tyme that the <hi>light</hi> do the manifest itfelfe clearely vnto Them.</p>
               <p>And although this seeme to an vnexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Man very symple, and facill to keep himself thus interiorly attentiue, as hath beene said to that <hi>internall light;</hi> neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les it is very laborsome, and hard to be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne: to reflect so symply vppon it, and so to continue, as is said. Yea to an vnmortifyed, and vnresigned Person it is impossible to hold Himself so symply to this Interior In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clynation; becaus this requyreth a constant and a perfect denudation of all Creatures, and a Resignation of Himself to <hi>God.</hi> In which internall disposition if any one can continue by what meanes soeuer it be; Hee is at the next doore to the highest perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And the soule doth continually by this internall symple obseruation, and vsing of this <hi>deuyne light</hi> all that shee did in that Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue Exercise of the aforesaid Poynts. For they must be continually in the soule essentially before shee be capable of this <hi>light.</hi> And consequently always remayn there, before the same can Continue in Her. In so much that the soule which after one of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:104174:132"/> wayes retayneth in her the <hi>deuyne light</hi> is also annihilated in herself, (albeit by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of her Imperfection shee be not yet aboue herselfe) And shee cannot before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn that <hi>light</hi> essentially in Her. And the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore like as <hi>Gods</hi> presence cannot be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned by Peices; but either whole, or not at all. In like manner the soule kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping herself rightly by this symple Louing inclynation of her Hart receiueth that <hi>deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne light</hi> also whole, entyer, and pure, as shee doth afterwards when, as thereby shee is eleuated aboue herself, and Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plateth <hi>God,</hi> although not after so cleare, and perfect a maner, becaus as yet shee doth not giue it sufficient way. For it cannot be mingled with her senses; but must be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt, and pure in her, or not at all. And therefore when wee said that it doth not come all at once, but by little, and little, is to be vnderstood, as is now said; that it doth not from the beginning perlu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, and enlighten the whole soule; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus shee doth not sufficiently open herself. Neuertheles the <hi>ligh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> in itself is always pure, and vnmingled. Like as the sunn shyning through the Clefts of a shutt window into the Chamber, that <hi>light</hi> of the sunn is pure, and vnmingled; albeit but according to one Beame; which is to be well noted, Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying the preparation to this <hi>light</hi> there is an interior clearnes; but that is no wise
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:104174:132"/> that <hi>deuyne light,</hi> whereof wee speake, but only a cleerenes in the powres of the soule. For this <hi>deuyne light</hi> requyreth that the sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le be wholy vacant, Empty, and wholy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated according to her former Being, &amp; become a pure <hi>Spiritt,</hi> before it can arise in her. And albeit the soule hath it somety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes in more, and lesse clearenes; and also contemplateth <hi>God</hi> on tyme clearer y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. Neuertheles the <hi>light,</hi> or <hi>Gods presence</hi> is not therefore at any tyme mingled with the senses; but that happens meerely by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the soule hath not always her <hi>interior light,</hi> and Capacity a like prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue <hi>light,</hi> and to vse it. And that the soule may better vnderstand this, lett her obserue that (as hath beene said) to each one of the former Poynts doth answere a certayn cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in the soule, when as shee exerciseth herself in the same, as shee ought; which Clearnes in its poynts is greater, or lesser according to the greater, or lesser Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherewith shee exercises herselfe in Them.</p>
               <p>But this <hi>Deuyne Light</hi> whereof wee now treat (goes before the <hi>deuyne presence,</hi> and dependeth thereof, as the shadow of the Body) can no more be obtayned by Peice meale y<seg rend="sup">n</seg>
                  <hi>God</hi> himself; and therefor is not in the soule till such tyme, as shee hath the former Poynts essentially in her. The soule hath also that in her in lesser, or greater clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renes,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:104174:133"/> and Perfection; but yet it must be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways vnmingled, and pure; as is said of the <hi>deuyne presence;</hi> and this the soule obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth cleerly who hath obtayned the same in her. For shee experienceth that by the least Image shee yeldeth vnto, or turns vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; shee wholy looseth that Noble, and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Light.</hi> Albeit notwithstanding shee retayneth in her a clearenes in the powrs by reason of the Abnegation of Creatures, and Resignation in <hi>God,</hi> wherein shee remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth yet in some certayn degree. But they cannot discerne this who haue not experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced this Noble <hi>Light;</hi> and therefor they esteeme themselues to be yet present to <hi>God,</hi> when as they perceiue but only this foresaid Clarity in Them; and in very deed are not free from Images which mediate them from <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And although wee haue giuen the name of a <hi>light</hi> to this <hi>deuyne Mercy</hi> in the soule; wee must not therefor think, that it is in the vnderstanding as other <hi>lights.</hi> For it doth penetrate, and flow through the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritt</hi> into the whole soule, and all her powrs; and replenisheth the same; as also produceth in the <hi>will</hi> a perfect ioy, and a heauenly satiety; whereby the Concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible powr of the soule doth continually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy a sublyme, and hidden <hi>Good</hi> which yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth such a heauenly Gust, and ioy that there with it holdeth itself wholy Content,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:104174:133"/> and satisfyed without desiring, or seeking as y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> any other Thing. For being that as well the will as the vnderstanding doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and leaue itselfe wholy for <hi>God-sake;</hi> so it also receiues its reward, and is recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced as well as the vnderstanding, and obtayneth the repose, and Peace in <hi>God</hi> which for his sake it hath forsaken in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And it is not only that infused <hi>light,</hi> and deuyne Gust by which the soule is so satisfyed but also the certaynty shee hath of the neerenes of the <hi>deuyne essence</hi> which shee knoweth to be without <hi>Medium,</hi> or meane present vnto Her, following this <hi>light</hi> as the day, the morning.

                  <p>How the soule by the deuyne light must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert herself to the deuyne Presence; with some signs to know whither her Conuersion be right.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NOW when as the soule by diligent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of the foresaid <hi>deuyne light</hi> (founded in this maner in the denudation of all Creatures, and Vacancy of her powrs) is become potent ouer herself, and the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyne light,</hi> y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> will she fynd herself internally inuyted to a more streight neerenes, and Vnion with <hi>God,</hi> and will perceiue in her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self an inward desyre to be wholy absorpt▪ and▪ Lost in <hi>God.</hi> For although shee be now wholy separated from all Creatures neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles shee fyndeth herself not so entyrely left, and rendred vp to <hi>God.</hi> And therefore easyly returneth to herself; And that <hi>deuyne light</hi> doth not satisfy her to the full, as it was wont to do. But it seemeth to Her that shee must fynd out some Thing aboue it. Which happeneth becaus shee is now come to a neerer Interior Likenes of <hi>God</hi> y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shee was. And y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> is it tyme for her to enter with that obtayned <hi>light</hi> into the <hi>kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedome of God within Her.</hi> Whereas hitherto shee stood only at the doore, but had not entred in, or begunn to conuert hersel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:104174:135"/> to the Contemplation of the presence of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how shee shall performe this, is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re obscure for her to learn y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> the former. For that it must be done through an inward operation wholy spirituall, such as the soule neuer hath produced any more pure, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, nor can on her part produce; wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ich by reason of its great purenes, and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matenes can hardly by word be explicated. The only Benefit is that the <hi>Spirit</hi> through the <hi>Interior light</hi> is thus prepared, and in so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me sort hath by experience learned how it must ioyn itself to <hi>God;</hi> and is now more established in the <hi>naked fayth,</hi> and pure Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue. Otherwise it were impossible to instruct her after what manner shee must conuert herself to the hidden presence of <hi>God</hi> in her. And yet neuertheles if shee do not withall possibility go, and stand to performe this secret Conuersion with requyred sympli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city shee shall neuer obtayn the noble pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of <hi>God</hi> without <hi>Medium,</hi> or meane.</p>
               <p>For this illuminated soule is like vnto a Man who hath kept his Bed all his life ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, or hath beene bound, so that hee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer could mak vse of his feete to go: albeit such an one wee sett vppon the Ground hauing his feete at Liberty, and Hee strong enough to go; neuertheles Hee must be fayn to be ledd for want only of vse, and would not be able to go alone. In the same maner
<pb facs="tcp:104174:136"/> albeit the <hi>Spirit</hi> now be freed from all inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and externall impediments, and is now at Liberty in itself, fitt now to be eleuated in <hi>God.</hi> Yet neuertheles by reason of its vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accustomednes, it must be holpen, and ledd to <hi>God;</hi> at least-wise shewed the way, the more becaus the maner after which it must Conuert itself to <hi>God</hi> in itself is so symple that it is wholy indiuisible; Neither can there be any thing added therevnto or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished, but it makes it vnfitt to fynd <hi>God.</hi> And although wee can giue no cleare Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, or certayne Rules by which wee may know after what maner this interior Conuersion to <hi>God</hi> must be done, hauing now surpassed all Obseruations, and Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which by reason of their Multiplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty would be a hinderance vnto <hi>Him.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles wee will giue some admonitions, and also signes which may serue <hi>Him</hi> the Better to fynd the same, and also to iudge afterwards whither hee haue it as Hee ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght, and haue rightly found it out.</p>
               <p>The illuminated soule Therefor must first know, that by no meanes shee must relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish her internall disposition which shee hath found in herself to be necessary for the receiuing, and retayning in her the <hi>deuyne light;</hi> but must with all possible diligence conserue it entyre, if shee actually haue it; or if shee fynd herself suarued from it, shee must first of all recouer, and renew the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:104174:136"/> before shee go about to Conuert Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to <hi>God.</hi> Becaus it is as needfull for the hidden presence of <hi>God,</hi> as the precedent <hi>light.</hi> Yea it is a necessary preparation to this.</p>
               <p>Therefore keeping herself vnbecombred, and recollected by the same, shee will fynd herself admonished that shee must conuert Her either in the superior, or inferior part of herself to <hi>God</hi> eleuating herself aboue all her senses, and Powres, and her whole Being; or all ouerwhelming the same, and depressing it vnto the very lowest of herself; and shee must by no meanes conuert herself to <hi>God</hi> in the midst of herself, shee so doing, shee will not keepe <hi>God</hi> the least tyme pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, yea which is more, shee will not once fynd him so present, not that <hi>God</hi> is lesse present there y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> aboue, or below in her (for Hee is present alike in the whole sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le) But becaus shee cannot be there eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted aboue herself, which (as is said) is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the fynding of <hi>Him.</hi> And that by reason shee cannot quite rid herself from the senses in the midst whereof shee is.</p>
               <p>Therefor lett her first of all reflect well vppon this, And for this caus loose no ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me but presently either eleuate herselfe in <hi>God,</hi> or sink herself wholy in <hi>Him.</hi> For to both these a pure, and sequestred soule is equally prepared; And to an exercised Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son it is as easy as to lift vp his hand aloft, or to lett it fall down, or with his eyes to loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:104174:137"/> vpwards, or downewards, and therefor the soule must accustome herself to haue the way pathed, and open in Her aswell vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as downewards to <hi>God.</hi> For the first is necessary for her in her externall workes in which shee cannot take <hi>God</hi> otherwise y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> vpwards: (as heerafter shall be taught) And the other is more applyable to the tyme of Prayer which shee maketh in tyme of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction; Becaus that shee being so sunk into herself is better preserued against all distractions, and excursions of the senses, and remayns in more quietnes, and solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynes, and consequently apter to obserue, and beare that inaction of <hi>God</hi> in Her. And therefor shee shall there in the depth of herself learn to sink vnder, and relinquish all Images, and gross operations of her powrs, and the more throughly, and deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shee doth it, the more secure shee will be from the adhesion of the senses, and the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gher eleuated in <hi>Spiritt,</hi> and consequently discouer, and fynd <hi>God</hi> clearer within Her. And after the former exercise shee will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, and fynd in herself a secret possibility how to performe this eleuation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, or down-sinking, which to vnex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised Persons is altogether vnknown. For<note place="margin">Worthy to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued</note> that which in these People is dispersed, and vnfolded, in the other is symply gathered, &amp; recollected; and is a meanes for the pure, &amp; introuerted soule to conuert her entyrely
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:104174:137"/> vpwards, or downwards to <hi>God,</hi> as before outwards to Creatures.</p>
               <p>But this eleuation, and down-sinking shee must do so symply; that albeit shee hee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re actually conuerteth herself to Another Obiect in respect of that which shee did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when shee only passiuely receiued the <hi>deuyne Light,</hi> and conuerted herself after the foresaid symple maner to the fynding out of the same; shee must neuertheles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this, keepe herself so introuerted as though shee did no such Thing. In so much that neither of the Conuersion itself; nor of the <hi>deuyne presence</hi> to which shee Conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth herself shee ought to frame, or haue any Image, or Likenes more y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> before shee did, or had. Yea not so much as to make any precedent Intention, or purpose of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting herself to <hi>God;</hi> for thereby shee would hinder the symplicity, and singlenes of her mynd. Yea being shee is now annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in Herself, neither may, nor can shee conuert herself, and the more shee doth it, shee is thereby more vnfitt for this present Conuersion; becaus it must be done aboue herself, &amp; shee cannot be aboue herself, but it must be effected by Another Powr to witt the <hi>Spirit</hi> which only can performe this Internall Conuersion; but withall pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible symplicity; standing in the <hi>Light</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof wee haue spoken shee must with a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of herself in perfect Peace, and <hi>Rest</hi> as
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:104174:138"/> though shee had <hi>God,</hi> or at least could not misse <hi>Him:</hi> vnlock, or open her interior ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther downwards, or vpwards; and shee will perceiue that a symple Powr will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Her which will stretch her forth; and conuert her to a hidden <hi>Good</hi> which is yet more intimate vnto Her y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> the <hi>light</hi> wherin shee hitherto stood. And shee must be very wary shee do nothing besides the first Conuersion. For that would be playnly agaynst the symplicity heere requyred; and thereby shee would fall into the Operation of her Powres, and senses. For the <hi>Spiritt</hi> hath no other operation y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> a symple Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion, and auersion which it performeth in a moment. True it is, it doth this Conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion with more agility, and swiftnes: also the very selfe-same tyme it keepeth itself with more, and more Attention, and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacity before <hi>God,</hi> and diueth deeper into <hi>Him;</hi> Yet neuertheles it is the selfesame vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinguished Internall operation; and this the soule must diligently reflect vppon. And in case shee perceiue that shee doth more y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> this symple Conuersion, and that shee cānot withhold herself (as often happens in the beginning) shee must endeauour to slipp away, and forgett this working, as all other euill Motions till as such tyme, that of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues they stay behind. Which will now be easy for her to do enioying always that symple <hi>Light</hi> by which her Powres are
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:104174:138"/> sweetly held in nakednes, Vacancy, and symplicity without molesting her by their working. And vppon the same the soule falleth, and resteth agayn whensoeuer shee doth not obtayn in herself rightly that <hi>deuyne obiect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus symply conuerting herself vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, or downwards to <hi>God</hi> shee will be as it were compassed, and receiued into a great darkenes, and hidden profundity in which shee will loose her Image, and simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude more profoundly y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> in the former <hi>Light;</hi> from which shee must now inwards draw her <hi>light</hi> of Contemplation, and in the inermost of this obscurity, and profundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty shee will perceiue a hidden increated <hi>Good</hi> which is more intymme, and present vnto Her y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> the precedent <hi>Light.</hi> And shee must open, dilate, and stretch forth herself to the vttermost of her Powr in the presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce thereof to be thereby instructed, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and wholy transformed, <hi>According to His good pleasure.</hi> So that all the operations of the <hi>Spiritt</hi> be with an interior Vigilancy, and liuelynes to keepe itselfe before the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyne Aspect,</hi> which will manifest itself vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it in a supernaturall clearenes.</p>
               <p>It is Neuertheles to be obserued that when as the <hi>Spiritt</hi> eleuateth itself to <hi>God</hi> aboue all Operation of the Powres, and senses, That it consisteth there more by way of Actiue Contemplation, Before <hi>God,</hi> so
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:104174:139"/> the passiue vnderstanding doth wholy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert itself to that hidden <hi>Good.</hi> But when as the <hi>Spirit</hi> diueing downwards sinketh it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in <hi>God;</hi> that is done more in passiue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Becaus it is cheifely the work of the <hi>will</hi> which rendreth, and resigneth itself wholy in <hi>God.</hi> And the soule is there more enioying, and possessing y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> Beholding, and Contemplating; hauing for her contrary Party the sensuall Concupiscence: Like as in the eleuation of the <hi>Spirit</hi> the Imaginary similitudes which heere wee must with such simplicity sinke vnder, as ascend, and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount the former. But by reason that as well the one as the other manner is very occult, or hidden, and that many therin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues themselues thinking they performe this Conuersion well, whereas neuertheles it appeareth that they do not enioy the true fruicts thereof. Wee will for more Certayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty giue some signs to the soule which shee shall obserue in herself, and thence know whither shee doth this Conuersion as shee ought.</p>
               <p>And these be the signs from whence the illuminated soule must take her Marke whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being after her manner conuerted to <hi>God</hi> shee finds herself not only free from her own Image, but also in an hidden internall <hi>Being</hi> wholy absorpt, and lost. For in this, differeth the enioying of the <hi>douyne presence</hi> in the soule, from the vse of the <hi>deuyne light</hi>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:104174:139"/> whereof wee haue now spoken; That the soule may attayn to this <hi>deuyne presence</hi> shee must not only be debarred frō all Creatures, &amp; herself, and wholy vacant, but must be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so eleuated aboue herselfe. Whereas for the receiuing of the <hi>deuyne Light</hi> it is sufficient shee be debarred from all Images, as hath beene said, and vacant from all proper wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. And so shee is but in an actuall separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not obliuion, and much lesse loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of herself. Neither is shee aboue tyme, and Place, and her own Image which (as hath beene said) the soule yet continually remembreth, albeit shee resteth not in her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self becaus shee hath cutt herself of from all adhering; and therefor euen with the least Commotion, or obseruation shee fyndeth herself agayn; yea shee is not otherwise lost y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> that shee doth not reflect vppon herself. The reason heereof is that the <hi>Light</hi> in the soule ariseth when as shee is in such manner prepared as wee haue said. But this <hi>deuyne essence</hi> is fart aboue the essence of the soule eleuated, and doth not in such maner arise of itself, nor powreth itself into Her. But to haue that present the soule must conuert herself vnto <hi>it</hi> aboue herself: hence shee is not only in an Obliuion of herself; but is much more estranged from herself, and also wholy conuerted to Another obiect aboue Her; yea not only conuerted, but wholy absorpt in the same; and therefor shee fyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:104174:140"/> herself in Truth as lost out of herself, not knowing how, or where shee is. For the <hi>Spirit</hi> is aboue tyme, and Place eleuated in a permanent <hi>eternity</hi> which hath not the least Communication with any Thing hee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re below. Heerevppon the soule must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect whither shee fynd herself thus inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riorly lost, wholy aboue, and out of herself; so that shee be actually annihilated in her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and transformed into Another <hi>Being,</hi> or that shee be only in an obliuion of herself, and betweene these two shee will easily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish after that shee hath experienced them Both. For this sign is easy to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. Yea when shee is some what practised, shee will soone discerne in her exterior man whither shee be so interiorly Lost in <hi>God,</hi> or no. For this Loosing doth caus a perfect ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of all working, and Quietnes of the Exterior Powres, and members. And as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soone as this <hi>loosing</hi> is not in its full Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, it will shew it presently in the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Man. For if the soule do not rest out of herself in <hi>God,</hi> y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> shee resteth in Nature wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ich must appeare in some part, or other of the Body.</p>
               <p>Another signe is whither hauing beene af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her maner for a while interiorly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted to <hi>God,</hi> shee fynd in this Conuersion any difficulty, or Payn in any of her powres, or Members by reason of the <hi>interior Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or force shee doth by Conuerting her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self

Yea if Hee were before tyred Hee would heereby be refreshed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouated better y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> by any other Meanes. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus this interior Conuersion doth wholy appease all Commotions, and perturbatiōs in the inferior Part: in so much as all his members euen the least are, as if they were a sleepe: which Corporall relaxation, and annihilation Hee will the more perceiue by how much neerer Hee approacheth to this true Conuersion to <hi>God.</hi> And in the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior part the soule being conuerted recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth a new <hi>force,</hi> and Spirituall <hi>ioy</hi> which doth also flow into the <hi>inferior Part</hi> of the soule yea into the whole Body which hee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby is inwardly strengthned, and refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. So that the true Conuersion to <hi>God</hi> doth no ways caus the least Tediousnes, or wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risomenes neither in the interior, or exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Man. And therefor when any weariso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes ariseth through the internall Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se it is an euident sign that the Corporall Parthath Cooperated; for that Alone can be wearyed, and not the <hi>Spiritt.</hi>

<pb n="273" facs="tcp:104174:141"/> by that shee is separated from all Creatures, and herself, and eleuated in <hi>God</hi> by which is engendred in her a free, vacant, and clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re mynd; free from all Temptations, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xations, and greife, or sorrow.

               <p>Shee seeth now how grossely, and stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly before shee sought <hi>God,</hi> when as with Images, and Considerations, and other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior Exercises shee conuerted Herself to <hi>Him;</hi> and cannot admyre sufficiently her former Blyndnes, and insensibility that whereas <hi>God</hi> is so nigh vnto her; shee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles hath no more known <hi>Him,</hi> nor reflected on <hi>Him;</hi> y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> as though Hee had beene farr from Her.

Also shee discerneth How much it is without all reason that shee should seek, or intend any Thing in <hi>God</hi> but Himself; and how impossible it is doing otherwise to be eleuated to the <hi>deuyne Vnion.</hi> Lastly shee hath now certaynly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, that which before shee only in obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity without experimentall knowledg be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiued of <hi>God,</hi> and doth actually experience that the more confidently, and resolutely shee casteth herself on <hi>God,</hi> and confydeth in <hi>Him,</hi> And the more prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Certaynty shee coueteth to haue, the lesse experimentall certaynty shee will fynd.</p>

And shee also clearely perceiueth that this is wholy hidden, and

               <p>To this soule enioying <hi>God</hi> wee can do no more y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> only admonish Her, that shee remayn diligent, and endeauour to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue where shee is now come.

<pb n="282" facs="tcp:104174:146"/> to eleuate herself to the contēplation of <hi>God,</hi> always diligently obseruing that through her fault shee yeild no place to any Thing which may any ways obscure this <hi>Light</hi> in Her. For like as shee could not obtayn the same but by a perfect <hi>Abnegation,</hi> and <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation</hi> of herself, so shee must of Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity liue, and dy in this <hi>nothing</hi> if shee meane to hold it: and for this caus shee must with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all possible swiftnes marke, and obserue all her senses, Powres, and Motions of her hart least peraduenture shee come to loose this happy <hi>nothing</hi> which can only make <hi>God</hi> present vnto Her: which obseruation of herself ought to be now much more easy<note place="margin">Our being nothing is Gods being at in vs.</note> vnto her being therevnto enabled by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the <hi>deuyne Light,</hi> and the <hi>secret presence</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and doth now clearely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue how shee doth willingly giue place in Herself to obscurity, and chaseth away that Heauenly <hi>Light,</hi> as often as shee in the least maner declyneth from that internall dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition by which shee is come thus farr.</p>
               <p>So that this soule enioying <hi>God</hi> must now resolue with herself to walk hence forward in an exceeding great purity, and Perfection of all Virtue. Yea it is necessary that from henceforth shee not only take vppon her a Virtuous life, but also a Heauenly, yea a deuyne conuersation accounting great, small defects: which Other Men do little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard; yea the least vndecentnes, or super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity

               <argument>
                  <p>How the soule through her old Defects is diuersely hindered; that shee cannot peaceahly Continue in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of God.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WHEN as now the soule enioying <hi>God</hi> doth in this maner all her endeauour to retayn the hidden <hi>presence of God</hi> to which shee is happyly arriued, and endeauoureth as is said to keepe her <hi>interior sight</hi> always conuerted to the same; shee will fynd that shee is but able for a short tyme to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue quietly therin. For the precedent impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments will oftentymes against her will draw her of, and auert Her from that gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefull <hi>Contemplation,</hi> and enioying of <hi>God.</hi> For albeit the scale, or thicke skinn be now taken away from her eyes as hath beene said; and that the blynd Man to whom wee formerly compared Her being freed from the scales of his eyes doth easily behold at all tymes, and places the <hi>Light</hi> of the sunn; Neuertheles it goeth not so with the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior eye of the soule. For when the scale of the corporall eye is once taken quite away the Party is ridd of it, and is so wholy freed thereof as though Hee neuer had had any scale at all. But although the soule be once freed from the scale of her eyes; Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:104174:148"/> it returneth agayn as easily as the earth, or Mudd that lyeth in the Bottome of the water mingleth itself with the water at the least Motion thereof making it thick, and taking away the clearenes thereof. In like maner the senses which caus the scales vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon our interior eyes are but sunk downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards as hath beene said, and therefor do easily ascend vpwards agayn, and are farr more easily mingled with the <hi>Spirit</hi> vppon the least Commotion, y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> the Earth with the water.</p>
               <p>Which commotions do happen often in the soule. For albeit shee hath wholy forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken all Creatures without, and resigned herself perfectly vnto <hi>God,</hi> and that out of <hi>pure Loue,</hi> and standeth now in <hi>naked fayth</hi> as hath beene said, and consequently ought to be as a Bird free from all bands, cleau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings too, and imprisonments, flying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hinderance in the Ayr. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les by reason there yet remayneth in Her the Inclynation to Creatures, and the roote of self-Loue is yet in Her; which are the bands, and tyes wherewith shee hath bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne bound shee is easily taken agayn, and tyed aswell to Creatures without her, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to herself. Likewise the senses that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayn quiet, and vacant (are troublesome being accustomed euery where to cooperate and to haue their share, and Contentment of all) oftentymes seeke for some sensible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:104174:149"/> and feeling in <hi>God,</hi> or intrude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues into the interior operations of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and perturbe the same with their grossenes, and so the interior eye of the sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le is thereby obscured, and hindered in the Contemplation of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither is this against that which wee haue formerly taught, to wit, that the soule by the internall preparation becometh dead, and annihilated, for so shee is in verity, and before <hi>God.</hi> Becaus according to her free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will shee is for <hi>God-sake</hi> dead to all Creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, and to Herself for all Eternity, and doth also her endeauour at all tymes to forsake all affections, impressions, and operations, &amp; to mortify them, &amp; annihilate them for <hi>God</hi> which when shee actually effecteth (as being truly dead, &amp; annihilated) shee fyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, &amp; enioyeth <hi>God</hi> for that tyme. But neuertheles shee hath not yet perfectly▪ and in very Truth rendered vpp her <hi>Spirit,</hi> nor is wholy freed of her created Image. For Nature, &amp; senses are not yet perfectly roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out; &amp; therefore shee oftentymes falls back agayn into them, &amp; returns to her own being, not through her own will, but for want of long exercise not hauing yet sufficiently practised this <hi>death,</hi> and Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation. Hence this actuall <hi>death,</hi> and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation in her is not constant; not conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently this <hi>presence</hi> of <hi>God</hi> which cannot remayn in her without them. Hence it is
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:104174:149"/> that the soule enioying <hi>God</hi> is often trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled vexed, and disquieted agaynst her will according to the diuersity of her affections, and inclynations, as also incident Images, and impressions, and Thoughts; and hee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby is the <hi>Spiritt</hi> necessaryly hindred in contemplating, and enioying <hi>God.</hi> For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though these Images, and impressions, and commotions be not in the <hi>Spiritt,</hi> not can come thither, but only in the inferior part of the soule where they always haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into, and so long as the same is not actually suspended, and drawn vpp into the superior part; the <hi>Spiritt</hi> can hardly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold itself from conuerting itself vnto them; by reason of the Vnion which it hath with the inferior part. And albeit that this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion is commonly without adhering to; or as it were vnaduisedly, and without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation: yet neuertheles for that present, it hindereth this spirituall <hi>death,</hi> and Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation, and consequently the enioying of <hi>Gods presence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And albeit the <hi>Spiritt</hi> were freed from all these hinderances, and not withdrawn by these incident impressions, and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the soule; neuertheles it cannot at the beginning continue long eleuated in <hi>God</hi> by reason of its inbred instability thr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough which it can hardly fix itself any long tyme vppon any thing: but oftentymes, &amp; easily falleth from it agaynst its will through
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:104174:150"/> a naturall forgetfullnes to which It neuer hath more occasion y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> in this present exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise to <hi>God.</hi> For in this It is with all the Powrs of the soule, and all her possibility as vppon a poynt recollected, and inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attentiue to <hi>God.</hi> From which Attention, and recollection when as but any one of the Powres, or senses doth withdraw itself, And that the <hi>Spirit</hi> doth in the least maner inclyne itself therevnto: in that very instant it looseth the <hi>deuyne Obiect</hi> wholy, as hath beene said: which the more must happen becaus that this <hi>deuyne obiect</hi> is in itself so eleuated aboue the apprehension of the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and Powres; and they haue there so little experience, and satisfaction that they draw very easily themselues from this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Attention, whereby the <hi>Spirit</hi> is oftentymes hindered in this gratefull Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And albeit that all these impediments are in this of like nature, that each of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue the soule wholy from the <hi>deuyne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> Neuertheles the one estrangeth Her from it, more y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> the other. For some do take from her only the Recordation of <hi>God;</hi> but others do moreouer interpose an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment betwixt <hi>God,</hi> and the soule which also remayneth although the remembrance of <hi>God</hi> be renewed in Her. And this impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment is also greater in one y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> Another. Like as when the soule through her natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:104174:150"/> Instability looseth <hi>God</hi> without yeilding place in Her to Commotions of the senses, albeit shee thereby receiue an Impression, Neuertheles shee only remayneth symply auerted from <hi>God.</hi> For although there be also in her a Conuersion to some Creature: it is notwithstanding without adhesion the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revnto, and therefore by a simple Recorda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>God</hi> shee is rectifyed agayn, and Conuerted without hinderance to <hi>God.</hi> But when as by some commotion, or perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion contrary to the absolute <hi>Abnegation,</hi> &amp; <hi>Perfect Resignation</hi> before mentioned shee is auerted from <hi>God:</hi> there is besides the Auersion, a Conuersion to some Creature, &amp; that with adhesion which is sometymes more, sometymes lesse, &amp; always causeth a Commotion in the Soule, &amp; obscureth the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which also remayneth when as <hi>It</hi> by a symple Conuersion returneth ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ayn to <hi>God,</hi> so that thereby shee remayneth mediated from <hi>God</hi> till such tyme as the Commotion through the Vigour of <hi>Spirit</hi> be wholy appeased in the soule, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity expelled.</p>
               <p>It is other wayes; when as the soule con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the purenes of Loue seeketh herself in <hi>God</hi> desyring to rest in his guists, or in the <hi>deuyne presence</hi> with propriety, and sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe-loue. For y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> shee is not conuerted to any created thing distinct from her, but there ariseth in her a <hi>dark clowd,</hi> a great obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:104174:151"/> which doth more hinder, &amp; estrange her from <hi>God</hi> y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> the precedent Conuersion to creatures. Becaus that the same doth wholy change the <hi>deuyne obiect</hi> in the soule making that of vncreated, &amp; supernaturall, created, &amp; Naturall.</p>
               <p>But the most hurtfull impediment is; when as <hi>in the soule ariseth</hi> some doubtfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes against the <hi>naked fayth</hi> aboue described which easily happeneth in the vnexercised persons. For before the <hi>Spiritt</hi> hath gotten full powr ouer the senses shee can very hardly represse them; but that they will co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet some naturall certaynty in <hi>God,</hi> &amp; w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Lo Thus it is, that albeit the soule hath now found her beloued according to her desyre. So that now shee no more needeth humayn Instruction to approach neerer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Him,</hi> yet notwithstanding in this quiet possessing, and enioying of <hi>God</hi> shee is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersely both exteriorly, &amp; interiorly hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; wherin it very much importeth her to be instructed how shee shall behaue her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <p>For this maner of proceeding which shee must vse to ouercome all her impediments, is so much different from the precedent as the state wherin shee now actually consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth, is different from that wherin shee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was. Yea when as the <hi>Spirit</hi> hath found out this secret Conuersion heere decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red shee hath need of no other knowledg y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> how shee shall behaue herself agaynst all impediments impugning on all sides, &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauouring to depriue her of <hi>God;</hi> least shee sustayn dammage by them.

               <p>Heerin must wee yet instruct the soule enioying <hi>God;</hi> for shee is subiect to many such violent, and forcyble impugnations which often continue long, and would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so withdraw her sometymes very hurtfully from <hi>God,</hi> and force her to yield place to her inordinate, and vnbridled affections, and passions; or if shee did couradgiously withstand them, it would be operatiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with great Labour, and so thereby shee would be mediated from <hi>God,</hi> and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect much progres.</p>

               <p>But in case the suffering, and payn wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ich the soule feeleth were such as shee could not descend therevnto, and subiect herself to the same in such wise as hath beene said, but must of necessity eleuate Herself opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely vpwards vnto them, shee would not be able by reason of this working to behold the same so <hi>deuynely;</hi> (as wee shall present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shew her) the reason whereof wee for Breuityes sake lett pass, thinking it sufficient to haue giuen to the saythfull soule only an <hi>item</hi> of it, who at such tyme (that shee may not forsake her beloued) shall hold herself

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly</hi> being thus descended down, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> conuerted to the present payn, and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the soule must not in respect thereof do any thing to alter, and chang the same; neither may shee desyre it greater, or lesser, or other ways y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> shee actually feeleth the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. But shee must receiue it, as it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vnto her, and hold herself passiuely as though shee could in no wise alter the same. For being that it is sometymes in Mans powr; He is too prone to do it; whereby notwithstanding (besides that Hee offends agaynst Annihilation] Hee makes this <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyne obiect</hi> wholy naturall, as being in his powr, and so it comes to pass that the soule looseth all internall reuerence to the same. The soule Therefor must auoyd all such like working▪ and exhibitt herselfe so symply to this suffering Payn as shee doth to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of the <hi>Deuinity.</hi> Yea more symply. For the interior working itself by which shee retayneth the <hi>deuyne presence</hi> in Her hath heere oftentymes no Place. For when as the suffering is altogether sensible: it putts her it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self sufficiently in Mynd thereof; so that it is needles for the soule to vse any force to conuert herself therevnto, yea thereby shee
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:104174:168"/> would the sooner represent vnto herself that Image of the payn, and suffering wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ich is not so with the <hi>Deuyne presence</hi> which is so secret, insensible, and incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</p>
               <p>Lo when the soule behaueth herself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriorly after this maner shee will behold the Payn, and suffering which shee feeleth, as the <hi>crosse of Chryst,</hi> and will feele in herself a Reuerence therevnto, as to <hi>Chryst</hi> hanging vppon the Crosse which will thus of itself be produced in her, she not thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, or intending the same; which must be well obserued; for if the soule did take suffering otherways: that would make an Image, and hinder her from <hi>God.</hi> Becaus this remembrance, or reflection is too gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, and Operatiue for the state, and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition wherin shee standeth. The soule the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refor must not think of <hi>Christ,</hi> or his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but symply conuert herself to that suffering in Her after the maner before said, and then the same will shew itself to her as the suffering of <hi>Chryst;</hi> and there will arise in her an Intimate Reuerence of the same, as to <hi>Chryst</hi> crucifyed. For shee beholdeth the payn, and suffering as a created thing vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the <hi>Deuinity</hi> which is only the Humanity of Chryst whereof shee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth an Internall Wittnes surpassing all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Reason▪ and shee seeth also cleerely that no humayne vnderstanding, or powr

               <p>And becaus shee cannot comprehend how, or after what maner the Vnion of that suffering can Consist with the impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Diety</hi> (in which shee can neuer retayn any other Image in Her without being the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby separated from <hi>God</hi>) shee remayneth in a continuall expectation: that, that be clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely shewed vnto her, and that thereby shee might more euidently know what and how <hi>God</hi> suffered in his Humanity. And this Continuall, and constant Expectation of the Manifestation of <hi>God</hi> according to his <hi>deuinity</hi> was her Interior Exercise.

Yea by reason the Payn, and suffering
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:104174:169"/> are more present vnto her then the hidden Diety, and are wholy Contrary to the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and their Naturall Inclynation, shee alone is thereby conuerted to them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayn (as heeretofore hath beene said) mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re powrefully separated from all Creatures, and Herself, and Vnited with <hi>God:</hi> y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> shee would be exercising herself in <hi>naked fayth.</hi> But this Exercise, and all that wee say of it can in no wise be vnderstood by <hi>Him</hi> who hath not exercised himself before in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, and Vacancy of all Creatures, and Himselfe, as hath formerly beene taught. For being that such an one standeth in Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, Hee is not able to eleuate in such maner the sufferance which happeneth vnto <hi>Him</hi> aboue that sensible feeling of the Externall Man, nor to conuert himself so symply to the same interiorly with the <hi>deuyne Light,</hi> whereas notwithstanding this Exercise soly consisteth therin; so that necessaryly that which wee haue formerly taught must go before in <hi>him</hi> who in his payn, and suffering will behold <hi>Christ Crucifyed</hi> after this fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resaid maner: yea Hee must be reasonably well practised therin before hee be able to Exercise Himself internally after this maner in Chrysts Passion.</p>
               <p>The soule Therefor enioying <hi>God</hi> must reflect well vppon this: that shee may besi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des the former <hi>internall Exercise,</hi> learn also this noble practise, and Art. For then shee
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:104174:170"/> will no more feare any Payn, sufferance Contempt, or vexation: but will ioyfully receaue them, and willingly meete them; that by the same shee may be perfectly vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and conformable to her Crucifyed Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour. Wherefor when shee is reasonably well practised in the precedent Exerc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>se of the <hi>Deuinity,</hi> shee shall apply herself inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to the incident sufferance which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth vnto her in such maner, as hath now beene said. And that not only when shee is cōpelled therevnto by violence of the payn, and sufferance, but also as often as shee fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth any particular Payn, affliction, or Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes of Hart. For that is the true, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maner according to which a soule Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>God</hi> must behaue herself in all aduersity which happeneth vnto her. Neither can shee (consisting in this Exercise which wee haue heere sett down) without interior dammage endeauour any ways to alter the happening sufferance howsoeuer, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer it be, or by any humayn meanes (th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough otherwise lawfull) seeke to mittigate, &amp; lessen the same. For that is agaynst the <hi>pure Loue</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and true hatred of herself, and the following of Chryst which shee must perpetually practise. Neuertheles this is not to be vnderstood of corporall payns which oftentymes requyres otherwise; but of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall greif, afflictions, and other Aduersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes: all which shee must endure to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:104174:170"/> as hath beene said, or else shee will be interiorly obscured thereby. And this is the most excellent, and perfect way to exercise ones self in the Passion of <hi>Chryst</hi> incomparably more gratefull, and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Christ, and more profitable to the soule, then if shee should by Images, and Imaginations represent the same vnto Her.</p>

               <p>It is with <hi>Him</hi> who remayns in those other Exercises like as with one who hath
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:104174:176"/> the sight eyes very dymme, and only recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth thereby some little glymps, or refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>Lig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t</hi> in his eyes; such an one is very easily wholy depriued of the enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof; at the least the same is obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red through any clowd shanging in the Ayr, or any Myst; Hee knoweth not whither it be Day, or Night, and often feares Hee is faln back into his old blindnes, and so Hee is soon contristated, and disquieted. Which happens by reason Hee seeth not the Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall impediments which depriue <hi>Him</hi> of the <hi>Light;</hi> as also neuer hath rightly beheld the <hi>Light</hi> in itself, but only some shyning, or clearnes issuing thence. And therefore Hee knoweth not that the <hi>Light</hi> of its, own Part neuer denyes, or hydes it-self; but only is hindred that it cannot sprend forth its beames. In like maner these who thr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough <hi>naked fayth</hi> haue neuer beene eleuated aboue the senses to receiue, and enioy that <hi>denyne Light</hi> essentially in themselues; but haue only in their powres a glymps thereof: being they stand in a nakednes, and Vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy though not so foundamentall, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as is requyred to that <hi>essentiall Light,</hi> &amp; therefore the internall eye in them is yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scured. Those are often depriued of their <hi>internall Light,</hi> and y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> they know not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Light</hi> is gone, or how, or after what maner they shall come thither agayn, and feare they shall be for euer depriued
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:104174:177"/> thereof. And therefor fall into great greif; and trouble of Mynd by which they are more interiorly obscured, and estranged from <hi>God;</hi> and by reason they know not their impediments they imagin that <hi>God</hi> hath withdrawn Himself from them. And albeit the foresaid Man of Himself, when tyme is, receiueth agayn that <hi>Externall Light,</hi> Neuertheles these soules by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son they are defectiue in the <hi>true fayth</hi> and giue eare to the senses they become more, and more intangled, and Blinded: so that also <hi>God</hi> by reason of their inordinate Affections, and irresignations cannot shew himself internally vnto them; and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes also fynding themselues in this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But this soule enioying <hi>God,</hi> is as one who hath the sight of this eyes cleere, and free from all impediments, and therefor clearely beholdeth the beames of the sunn how they flow, and proceed from thence. This Man (albeit by Night the sunn doth not shyne, and leaues vs in darkenes, yea also oftenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes by Day is obscured through dark clowds, or through thick Mysts is not to be seene) doth not esteeme himself to be left, or depriued of the same; neither doth Hee
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:104174:177"/> disquiet, or contristate Himself; becaus as then Hee cannot see, and enioy the cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the sunn. Knowing by experience that the same remayns alwayes in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that it of its own Nature denyeth not the <hi>Light,</hi> but is externally hindred that it cannot send forth the same vnto <hi>Him;</hi> and Hee knoweth also that after Night, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns Day, and that these clowds, &amp; thick Mists will passe away, and the accustomed clearnes of the <hi>Light</hi> return agayn. In like maner this illuminated soule who hath her <hi>internall sight</hi> wholy cleare, and pure (for shee stands eleuated aboue the senses <hi>in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked fayth</hi>) doth without impediment en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy in herself that <hi>Internall Light,</hi> and <hi>deuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne presence</hi> not fearing to be depriued of the same.

So now wee might also well say vnto her that the state wherin hence forward shee must liue is not only as d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

For shee must be so much more separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from all that is Corporall, Earthly, and created, and in herself so much more naked cleare, and Vacant to that which hitherto shee hath beene, as the Ayr is more subtile, and clearer y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> the Earth, or the water. And shee must not only receiue that <hi>deuyne light</hi> like as the Body through the eye doth recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue the <hi>Light</hi> of the Sunn, for that being tender, and delicate can easily be hindred, and made vnfitt for receiuing of that <hi>Light;</hi> and albeit shee actually receiue it, yet is it very sparingly for the whole Body, the eye excepted remayns obscure, and dark with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing, or discerning any Thing of the <hi>Light.</hi> But heere it would be necessary that the soule were <hi>nothing</hi> but wholy <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritt;</hi> And that all her powres, senses, and
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:104174:185"/> Commotions were wholy absorpt in the same; that her naturall operations had <hi>noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of Corporality in them, but were purely Spirituall. Shee ought to be like vnto a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that hath in euery Member an eye, yea that were <hi>nothing</hi> but one eye, that of all si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des equally, and commodiously receiueth in itself the <hi>Light</hi> of the sunn. And becaus wee cannot fynd such an one, wee haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened the soule to a cleare, pure, and open Ayr which amongst all Created Things of its own Nature hath the most aptnes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the <hi>light</hi> of the sunn at all tymes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out impediment. And therefor this soule (which in all Multiplicity must remayn vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with <hi>God,</hi> and interiorly eleuated in this heauenly <hi>Light</hi>) ought to Imitate the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Condition, and Disposition of the Ayr which therefor wee will expres more at lardg. The reason why the Ayr so easily, and fittly receiueth in it, the <hi>light</hi> of the sunn. Is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <hi>First</hi> becaus of its own Nature it is subtilex for amongst all corporall Creatures there is none so subtile as the Ayr which can neither be seene, or felt. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi> becaus it doth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adhere to itself, or any other Thing. Not to itself, for it is easily separated, and leuided, and yields to all things that do oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre without resistance, or Commotion, so that being driuen with violent wynds from the one side to the other it remayns a like cleare, and retayns euer its naturall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:104174:186"/> It cleaues not to any thing from without for albeit it toucheth, and filleth all things, yet neuertheles it mingles itself with <hi>nothing,</hi> but leaues it very easily, and departs from thence, as though it had not touched, or had beene therin.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <hi>Moreouer</hi> it is not in itself operatiue, but hath a pure receptability to all things, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it self in a passiue maner to all. Such like are not water, Earth, Fyre, nor other Things which are compounded of them. For they be either too grosse by nature, or too Adhering to one Another, or too ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue, so that the sunn cannot penetrate with its beames, and shyne through them, and therefor only casteth its <hi>Light</hi> vppon the outside of them. But the Ayr; it always fyndeth ready to receiue the <hi>Light,</hi> and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refor doth sweetely perlustrate the same from one side to the other dwelling therin with its <hi>Light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lo thus ought to be the internall disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the soule which at all tymes, and Places, and in Busines (as hath beene said) will remayn vnited with her <hi>God,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn that <hi>Deuyne Light</hi> without impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>First</hi> shee must be subtile, pure, and cleare for albeit the soule be such by nature being created by <hi>God</hi> a pure <hi>Spiritt</hi> shee is notwithstanding become wholy grosse, and earthly by reason shee hath so much adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red through inordinate Affection to earthly
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:104174:186"/> Things, and is in herself altogether obscured through the adioyning of the grosser senses. And albeit that by the precedent exercises, and particularly the perfect Abnegation of all created things shee hath separated her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from all adhesion vnto them, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in herself pure, and cleare; neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les shee is not pure, and cleare enough, nor sufficiently separated from the senses to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn in herself that Internall <hi>deuyne light</hi> in the midst of Multiplicity to which is requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red incomparable more purity, and cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> to receiue the same in abstraction of all Things. For in this case it is also neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary that the <hi>light</hi> do likewise penetrate, and shyne through the powres, and senses of the soule. But in the other it is sufficient that they do not hinder the same from entring into the soule.</p>
               <p>When the soule in her recollection, and solitude is prepared in herself; shee is like vnto a chamber which through an open window receiueth the <hi>Light,</hi> and includeth the same in it which is indeed illuminated within; And such as be in it enioyeth the <hi>Light</hi> therin included, but cannot see fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the same y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> within the walls of the Chamber. But Hee who in his Extro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion to Creatures will retayn the <hi>deuyne light</hi> must be like vnto one who stands in the open Ayr where on all sides hee sees without impediment being placed in the
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:104174:187"/> midst of the <hi>Light</hi> wherin hee beholds all things euen such as be a farr of. Whereas the other seeth only things within the Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se of the roome; But this soule is not yet co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to so great an Internall Clearenes. For shee as yet hath only learned to sequestrate herself from all Creatures, and thereby shee hath receiued that <hi>Light</hi> within Her: but shee is not yet come aboue the Creatures, and therefor shee hath not yet the <hi>light</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards whereto much more subtility, and clearenes is requyred. For her powres, and senses which now are shutt vpp, and auer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from all Creatures must be opened, and extrouerted to them, and yet neuertheles remayn in such Liberty, and Vacancy that the <hi>deuyne light</hi> may also shyne in her, and through her. Like as the <hi>light</hi> of the sunn in, and through the open Ayr. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi> shee may not adhere to herself, nor to any Thing without her; and albeit this soule enioying <hi>God</hi> through the perfect Resignation of herself, and pure Loue before expressed think herself to be free from all adhesion being shee willingly doth not adhere to any Creature; neuertheles shee is not actually so loose, and free as the Ayr (so that all which can exteriorly, or interiorly happen vnto her do so passe by that they leaue in her no impression or sign, nor in the least ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner moue, or trouble her, no more y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> if shee were dead, and insensible) And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:104174:187"/> is shee in Multiplicity obscured in her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; and excludeth that <hi>Light</hi> out of He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. Shee must therefor become so loose, and free from all adhesion to whatsoeuer is without her, that shee see, touch, conuert, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert herself from the same without hauing at that very instant any admixture thereof, or retayning any afterwards, no more y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> as if those things were not in themselues, or as though shee neither saw them, nor knew them. And this is incomparably more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyred, y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> to be simply auerted from all Creatures, and resigned in <hi>God,</hi> like as hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto shee hath endeauoured to be.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <hi>Finally</hi> the soule must also be wholy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought from the grosse working of her powres, and senses, and remayn in a pure passiue receptability to that inflowing <hi>deuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne light;</hi> and albeit shee hath learned this, and internall practised it in her solitude, and <hi>Rest</hi> according to the former instructions giuen vnto her; yet is it incomparably oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erwise to retayn this symplicity of Mynd in Exterior Busynesses, and Multiplicityes then in solitude. For heere shee must work with her powrs, and senses, and yet so symply that shee do not in the least maner disquiet her <hi>internall Peace,</hi> nor declyne a iot from the vneffigiated equality, and solitude of Mynd, no more y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> as if shee were wholy vacant; for otherwise shee hindereth the <hi>deuyne light,</hi> and expells it out of her.</p>
               <pb n="366" facs="tcp:104174:188"/>
               <p>By this externall similitude wee may wel discerne the internall disposition of the sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, which as hath beene sayd must in all Multiplicity constantly retayn in Her that <hi>deuyne light,</hi> and vnion. And it appeares by the same that shee ought to be wholy loose, and free from all adhesion to herself, and all Creatures, not only in <hi>will,</hi> and desyre, but also actually, and that shee must haue in her the supreame Perfection, the pure Loue, and <hi>naked fayth</hi> before mentioned, so that shee be truly <hi>dead,</hi> and <hi>annihilated</hi> to all Affection, and only liue according to the <hi>Spirit in God,</hi> and consequently more an Angell, y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> a Man.</p>

Neuertheles to make the soule (which thus farr wee haue brou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght) to beleiue this, it is needles to vse ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny words. For as in the Beginning hath bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne said, that assoone as shee is once come to the true <hi>Vnion</hi> with <hi>God</hi> shee knoweth it clearely to be thus, and that shee on her part at all tymes, and places can retayn the same; and therefor wee hold it sufficient to renew this <hi>Truth</hi> vnto Her, and speake heere principally to such who as yet are not come to this true <hi>Vnion with God.</hi>

For <hi>God</hi> is aswell as present vnto vs in the midst of multiplicity, as in abstraction, and Recollection.

               <p>The fault also cannot be imputed to the Externall works, and things.

For as heereafter shall be taught The Vnion with <hi>God</hi> doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyre an actuall Attention in the soule to <hi>God;</hi> But it suffiseth that shee continue in that preparation to <hi>God</hi> heretofore expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. For when shee retayneth this in her shee remayneth with <hi>God.</hi> Neither can shee loose this interior disposition by externall works; but by her own default.

And
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:104174:189"/> on the Contrary the Peace of Hart makes the soule present to herself, and causeth an interior clearenes yea a <hi>deuyne light</hi> (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath beene said) which hinders <hi>nothing</hi> at all, but helps.

               </p>
               <p>Which noble secret Art cannot properly

<pb facs="tcp:104174:195"/> least sensuality, immortification, or inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency in her Exterior Man causeth her to fall from this <hi>eleuation</hi> to the Ground.</p>
               <p>And albeit that the soule hath not yet found <hi>God</hi> in her solitude. Yet shee must not for all that desist from obseruing all her<note place="margin">Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

For besides that this must not at any tyme be omitted of one who intends to obtayn <hi>God</hi> being necessary for the obtayning of <hi>him</hi> in his solitude. It often happeneth that Beginners in symple exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall works experience more of <hi>God</hi> y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> they do in the place of their Prayer, and in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questration thence ensuing. Becaus they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue not as yet gotten the perfect Maystry ouer their senses, and powrs, nor can keepe them simply enough captiue in the <hi>naked fayth;</hi> and the more they striue to do it, the more Rebellion they feele; and fynd themselues further from <hi>God.</hi> But when as they busy themselues with some simple exterior work the powrs, and senses are conuerted to that exterior obiect. And being that the same is done without adhesion, or inordination the <hi>Spiritt</hi> receiueth thereby no hinderance, and so doth sometymes make a swift assent to <hi>God,</hi> and surmounts that exterior obiect fynding the way open. And such like per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons may seeke to do such works when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniency requyreth the same, but not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. For (as hath beene said) it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to conuert ourselues exteriorly to any
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:104174:196"/> work without necessity. And this is done out of a good intention thereby to aduance themselues towards <hi>God</hi> more y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> by Prayer made in sequestration.</p>
               <p>But to make profitt heereby they ought diligently to reflect how they be exteriorly disposed when as they so perceiue in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues the neerenes of <hi>God,</hi> and obserue how simply the <hi>Spiritt</hi> doth eleuate itself aboue the senses, and powrs to <hi>God,</hi> indeauour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But becaus that one man is of Nature much more vehement, and inordinate then Another. Such therfor that by reason of theyr inordinatenes do not experience such enlightning in themselues (albeit they haue exercised themselues in Prayer more y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> the others, as also haue obtayned therin some Manifestation of the <hi>deuyne Light,</hi> by which also they can in some sort keepe themselues, neuertheles they be not as yet come to the true <hi>presence of God</hi>) must not seeke by acts to fynd, orretayn that <hi>internall Light,</hi> nor the <hi>deuyne Preseuce</hi> in their Externall works; For that is not lawfull for them to do. For thereby they would go further from <hi>God</hi> endeauouring to obtayn <hi>Him</hi> by grosse Acts.</p>
               <pb n="383" facs="tcp:104174:196"/>
               <p>For being that in them the <hi>Spiritt</hi> is not yet perfectly separated from the senses, nor hath as yet any entrance in <hi>God</hi> they cannot in their externall works conuert themselues to <hi>God,</hi> but very grossely; and with admix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the senses. Nor can they fynd, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne in them that intimate operation whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof wee will presently speak, and such must not seek to do any thing else y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> to keepe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refully their <hi>internall Peace</hi> of Hart, and sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenes of mynd which they haue in tyme of their Prayer in sequestration. This is enough for them, and heerewith must they content themselues, and beleiue that thereby they will much sooner fynd <hi>God</hi> in Multiplicity, y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> by their Operatiue endeauour.</p>
               <p>For remayning so by their <hi>internall Peace</hi> the <hi>Spiritt</hi> is much more freed from the working of the senses, and Powrs, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to discouer the interior working by wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ich it must eleuate itself to <hi>God</hi> which must be heere produced with lesse Reflection of the soule y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> in tyme of her Prayer in seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration; and must sprowt more out of the interior nakednes, and vacancy of the soule, and that symple reflection on the externall work. And therefor such like soules must not seek to conuert themselues to <hi>God,</hi> or to eleuate themselues vnto <hi>Him;</hi> but symply auoyd, and lett go all Passions, Affections, and Commotions, and keepe themselues as free, and Vacant according to the interior
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:104174:197"/> Man, as possible they can, performe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior work faythfully. By this the <hi>Spiritt</hi> will by little, and little eleuate itself aboue the senses, and powrs, and the exterior ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to <hi>God,</hi> as heereafter wee will shew.</p>
               <p>And therevppon must shee diligently, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect remayning so symply by her work with a strict custody, and Mortification of her senses, and a perfect Peace, and tranquillity of hart willingly leauing that which shee is accustomed to experience in tyme of Prayer of the <hi>deuyne Light.</hi> For although shee did exercise herself in Prayer in the foresaid ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of interior inclynation; Neuertheles shee can in no-wise obserue; obserue▪ or retayn it in the externall works. For besides that (as wee haue said before) the same requireth the vacancy of the exterior Man, so cannot also [according to that which is said, &amp; shall be presently more at lardg taught] the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention (which must be kept during the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior work) be taken from any thing else y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> from the work, and in no wise from any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior working, or obseruation out of that externall work. So that the reflection the soule taketh vppon the interior Inclynation of the Hart, hath only Place in tyme of Prayer which is made in sequestration, and solitude. Vnles perhaps when as a Man is going quietly on a known way without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation. y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> may hee aptly keepe himself simply by that inclynation obseruing the
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:104174:197"/> same interiorly without reflecting what is before Him, or about him. For there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly hee doth not work, or actuate.</p>
               <p>But with no other Externall work can this Obseruation stand, becaus at least the eye<note place="margin">A true Inc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

For therefor it is called an <hi>Inclynation;</hi> becaus the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is fixed on nothing, but being free, and vacant inclynes itself to <hi>God▪</hi> But the soule which is come to the Contemplation of the hidden <hi>presence of God</hi> in herself, and by faythfull externall and internall exercise of herself hath now gotten a certayn accesse to the same must not content herself with this <hi>internall peace.</hi> But must also see that shee perseuer in the fruition of the <hi>deuyne presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,</hi> or at least in the foresaid actuall Vnion with <hi>God.</hi> Out of these two shee ought to be found at no tyme. For albeit shee cannot in all works retayn the fruition of the <hi>deuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne presence,</hi> yet there is none for which shee must omit the <hi>deuyne Vnion.</hi> For why shee cannot always enioy <hi>Gods</hi> presence, comes becaus shee cannot haue, or retayn it, but by an intimate introuersion to the same wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ich requyres to its perfection her whole at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. Now it often happens that the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall works [to be duely performed] do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyre the who leattention of the soule, or
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:104174:198"/> at least wise apart thereof; with which the <hi>Deuyne presence</hi> in the soule consequently cannot be retayned, and enioyed. And yet notwithstanding in such works the soule may well continue in the actuall Vnion with <hi>God</hi> whereof wee will speak in the next Chapter.</p>
               <p>And that the soule may know the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene the <hi>fruition of God,</hi> and the actuall Vnion with <hi>him,</hi> and so the better distinguish the exercise which wee heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue her for the simple works, from that which wee heereafter will giue for the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicious works, and such as requyres a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular attention. I say therefor that the sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le doth then enioy <hi>God</hi> in her exterior work when shee is aboue her exterior obiect, and aboue herself wholy raised in <hi>God,</hi> contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating, and reflecting on <hi>Him</hi> in such sympli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And becaus she can remayn thus attentiue to <hi>God</hi> in slight; and ordinary externall works which requyres no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Obseruation of the vnderstanding, nor senses. Therefor I say that in such exterior imployments the soule hath <hi>God</hi> truly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and enioyeth <hi>Him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>True it is that shee cannot for the present Open, and dilate herself as shee doth in her solitude, becaus through that exterior re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting vppon her work [although it be
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:104174:198"/> very symple] shee is hindred, and is not so wholy her own. Neuertheles shee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyeth truly <hi>God</hi> being with all capablenes conuerted to <hi>Him,</hi> and apt to harken to his inspiration, and to receiue whatsoeuer hee pleaseth to infuse into her as well, as in ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of her Prayer in abstraction which is to be vnderstood when the visitation of <hi>God</hi> is not forcible in the soule, nor of long Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance. For if it were: y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> were shee to lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue of the Exterior work to correspond, and satisfy also, for <hi>reuerence sake,</hi> as wee read of S. Francis that going on his way when Hee perceiued <hi>Gods</hi> visitation Hee would stand for <hi>Reuerence</hi> to the same. But in the externall works which exact a particular at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention the soule doth not Cōtemplate <hi>God</hi> in such manner, nor reflecteth on <hi>him,</hi> and therefor is not able at that tyme to obserue <hi>Gods</hi> visitation in her, neither is shee capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the same. Becaus the externall work requyres all her Attention, and shee must in a particular manner attend therevnto: which notwithstanding becaus shee doth it with a perfect Resignation of herself to <hi>God</hi> retayning the solitude of her hart, and her hart, and her mynd naked from all Images, shee remayns actually vnited to <hi>God,</hi> not hauing nor feeling in her any thing that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diateth betwixt <hi>Him,</hi> and her. And besides shee stands Continually in that <hi>deuyne light</hi> which serues her for a certayn sign of the
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:104174:199"/> actuall Vnion of her <hi>Spiritt</hi> with <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to know in what work the soule can retayn this fruition of <hi>God,</hi> or must helpe herself with the actuall <hi>Vnion:</hi> shee must diligently Examine when shee applyes her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to any work, of what kynd, or nature it is, whither it requyres a particular atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or no, or whither it be needfull shee reflect vppon it with her vnderstanding. For all works are not such, which do oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre; but many may be done with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior members which requyres very small reflection of the vnderstanding, and in such slight, and ordinary works the soule may continue in the Contemplating, and enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>God,</hi> as well, as in her solitude, and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of Prayer. And so when as such works occurr to be performed by her shee doth not satisfy if shee only content herself with the bare <hi>Vnion</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> and vse of the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyne Light.</hi> Yea shee would not be able to retayn them, becaus shee without absolute necessity departeth from the fruition of <hi>God</hi> which cannot be done without some affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or passion, whereby shee would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clyne from the <hi>Annihilation</hi> of herself, and consequently from the Vnion with <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to demonstrate to the soule that this can be done (to wit) that shee may retayn, and contemplate this happye <hi>deuyne preson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce</hi> in tyme of such symple works shee must know that Experience teacheth vs that the
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:104174:199"/> eyes can simply behold some obiect, and yet neuertheles the Man at the selfesame tyme with another sense, or powr be wholy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted to Another Obiect, and know only that, and rest wholy therin. This wee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue when wee read, or write any Thing attentiuely albeit that wee then behold ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriorly the letters, and paper. Neuertheles wee haue as it were no reflexion, or th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ought of the same, But the whole Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and attention of our soule is vppon that is written, and that the letters signifie; and that is the only Obiect to which wee are for the tyme conuerted, and the sight of the letters do serue for that end. But wee will adhere to our first assumed Comparison of the <hi>light</hi> of the sunn which more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly serues for the purpose, and best of all doth declare that which wee haue in hand. When as one goes a walking in a pleasant sunn-shyne in the spring of the yeare simply to inioy the exterior recreation of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull sunn-shyne. This Man although hee should constantly go, and behold the <hi>light</hi> shyning sunn, neuertheles hee would not fix therevppon his Intention, or vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his Gate, or going, or the <hi>exterior light</hi> or frame any Image thereof, but his whole extention; and thought would be but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the feeling, and Recreation Hee took in the pleasant shyning of the sunn wherin hee finally would rest. Which internall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:104174:200"/> notwithstanding hee could not more constantly retayn in <hi>Him,</hi> but by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing his Gate which Hee makes in the sunn shyne: for by that hee is actually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the <hi>light</hi> of the sunn, and to that end doth hee the same. So that Hee can very well together obserue how, and whither hee goes, and can still enioy the amiale sunn which shyneth vppon <hi>him</hi> without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting therevppon. To which if hee should only conuert himself Hee would not be able to do it so continually becaus hee must also some what obserue his going.</p>
               <p>Now as wee fynd by experience that wee can haue, and behold an exterior Obiect, and neuertheles wee are not thereby hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, yea rather furthered in the Continuall obseruing of another thing which through the beholding of such an Obiect wee soly intend; so can it also well be, that the soule in the foresaid internall exercise to <hi>God</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayn stedfastly eleuated by the externall sight of her eyes, or mouing of her Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers when it is done simply for <hi>God,</hi> and that through the pure intention which shee hath in y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> work to <hi>God;</hi> her <hi>Spirit</hi> may be directed aboue the work to <hi>God,</hi> and rest simply in <hi>Him,</hi> as in the sole end of the work. Yea this can be affected heere more easily y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wixt the powrs, and senses. For the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which which the soule in these internall exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises hath to <hi>God</hi> is meerely in the <hi>Spiritt</hi>
                  <pb n="391" facs="tcp:104174:200"/> which is incomparably more separated frō the exterior senses, y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> the powrs of the sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le: and in its operation depends much lesse on them, or is subiect vnto them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently in Contemplation of its interior Obiect the lesse hindered by them. Besides the <hi>Spiritt</hi> by the precedent Exercise is so separated, vnwrought, and interiorly ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to <hi>God,</hi> That it is always inclyning tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards <hi>Him,</hi> and also actually conuerting it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to <hi>Him;</hi> when as through the affections, senses, or powres of the soule it is not held back. And therefor being in these kynd of works it is not withdrawn or hindered, consequently of itself, it eleuates itself aboue the work to <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus it may be, that the soule in sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple works aboue her exterior Obiect conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues in the enioying of the <hi>deuyne presence</hi> without being hindred by distraction, or Image of that shee beholdeth exteriorly, or by the Motion, or working of her mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; and thus shee doth them without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, or conuersion, only applying the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revento her senses, and members as insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble instruments; and <hi>God</hi> is the sole <hi>drift,</hi> and <hi>scope</hi> of her work to whom also all her attention is Bent, during that exterior work. Yea that exterior doing, and reflexion ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues her for a Conuersion to <hi>God,</hi> and is an admonishment to her of <hi>God</hi> so-long as shee out of right Ordinance perseuers working
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:104174:201"/> purely for <hi>God.</hi> But to that end, it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that shee performe that reflecting, and beholding very simply, and Vacantly, so that all shee exteriorly seeth, or doth be in a passiue manner receiued by her. And that the exterior sight come more from without to her y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> by conuerting her out wardly to the exterior Obiect, which the soule must diligently obserue. for if shee by the least Opera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ion Conuert herself therevnto shee would be presently effigiated with that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall work. For shee would behold the same in itself, and so loose interiorly her <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation,</hi> and consequently the <hi>fruition</hi> of <hi>Gods presence.</hi> And therefor that Exterior sight, and reflection of the vnderstanding must be done with exceeding great sympli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. For although a Beginner who by puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of intention will know, and behold <hi>God</hi> in his work, doth behold <hi>him</hi> with a fixed eye (such being the will of <hi>God</hi>] whereby Hee is holpen to <hi>God</hi> neuertheles this may in no wise be heere permitted. For this soule doth not take <hi>God</hi> out of that externall work, as though shee had <hi>him</hi> not Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. For without that shee hath essentially obtayned <hi>him</hi> in her, and therefore shee doth not further herself principally by the work but only seekes to do the same after such manner that it doth not depriue her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriorly of <hi>God.</hi> And her greater progres comes of her interior Obseruation, and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refor

For (as hath beene said) the faythfull perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the necessary externall work must be always preferred before the internall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Soule; so that this also must be left willingly when the work which must be done according to <hi>God</hi> would t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And in that symple sight shee must temayn Constant; for the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby she remaynes intimately conuerted to <hi>God;</hi> so that shee must no more omit that simple reflection requyred to the work; y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> in tyme of Prayer shee may omit her inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Operation by which shee retayns <hi>God</hi> present, but yet no otherwise y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> after the foresaid symple manner, free, and vacant.</p>
               <p>And if the vnderstanding, and senses should inclyne themselues too much Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or Abstract, and print in themselues the exterior Image, of the work; or also that the inferior Extimulation, or riseing did Mingle itself therewith the <hi>Spiritt</hi> must symply indute all that as though it did not obserue the same (as wee heeretofore haue said) that shee must resist the incident di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractive thoughts. And it is to be obserued, that when as in such a symple work there
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:104174:202"/> happens at the same tyme seuerall things to be reflected vppon the soule ought to make vse, but of One of them to eleuate herself (as hath beene said) to <hi>God;</hi> and the Other shee must lett passe without reflecting vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them, in case the work permitt the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me.

               <p>To which end it is first necessary that when shee perceiues that the work which shee is to do, is such like as is said, that shee by no meanes striue to retayn, and enioy the <hi>presence of God</hi> in Her; but shee must willingly let it go; for otherwise shee would but loose tyme, and effect nothing; and shall only do her best to perseuer in the vse of the <hi>deuyne light,</hi> &amp; thereby in the actuall <hi>Vnion</hi> with <hi>God</hi> which wee before haue said that shee should do when as through the relent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her <hi>Spiritt</hi> shee is forced to leaue <hi>God.</hi> This may easily be done. For to this there is no obseruation, or particular atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion requyred; but it suffiseth that the soule haue no impediment on her part, remayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Abnegation of all Creatures, and perfect <hi>Resignation</hi> of herself to <hi>God</hi> whom shee now actually hath, and may well stand with that externall work how multiplicious

                  <pb n="407" facs="tcp:104174:208"/> and Vnited with <hi>God.</hi> And therefor this Conuersion is swifter y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> that which the <hi>Spiritt</hi> doth in the foresaid Interior exercise of quiet Prayer, or also of exterior symple works, and also more forceable, not being hindred through the Multiplicity: becaus in this, the <hi>Spiritt</hi> is conuerted to no Obiect with adhesion, but keepes itself eleuated aboue all Obiects: in so much that, That to which it is actually Conuerted to performe; the same, it can leaue euery Moment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out difficulty, as though it neuer had beene conuerted therevnto. Hence therefor the same Clarity of the <hi>deuyne Light</hi> from aboue doth also ansuere, or correspond vnto it, for the <hi>Spiritt</hi> by this foresaid auersion from all that is created stands alwayes in a conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient capablenes, which that <hi>heauenly light</hi> doth replenish.</p>
               <p>These two dispositions of the <hi>Spiritt</hi> as well in tyme of <hi>quiet Prayer,</hi> and symple works, as also this last of Multiplicious works agree notwithstanding heerin that both the One, and the Other requyres a continuall, and perfect annihilation of the whole Man. For as-well in this last in the Externall works, as in the first in quietnes; it is of necessity requyred that in the midst of Multiplicity all the powrs, and senses performe (as hath beene said) with much tranquillity, and Nakednes the work▪ as though all that is Exterior were not at all.
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:104174:209"/> Yea the soule which stands in this eleuation; is in a perfect Obliuion of herself being wholy auerted from herself, and eleuated aboue herself which is heere particularly. For when shee receiueth that <hi>light</hi> in her so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude shee is not (as hath beene said) aboue herself, nor in this Obliuion. Yet the first Exercise hath besides this Annihilation, and Obliuion also a <hi>loosing</hi> of the soule in <hi>God</hi> (as is said) which is not in this last; But the soule hath only in this an actuall Obliuion of herself, and of all exterior Things; And therefor very soone, &amp; easyly shee returns, and obserues herself, and other Creatures.</p>
               <p>And albeit that the soule in this present Exercise doth only remayn in an auersion from all that is created, and hath not an actuall fruition of <hi>God,</hi> as in the precedent, which serues her in tyme of solitude, and symple works; neuertheles shee hath more difficulty to keepe her after this manner ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated aboue herself, y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> after the other being that heere the soule must not only work without, but also contrary to her own cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynty, and feeling. For whereas the senses see, or obserue nothing in that Externall present Obiect but a corporall thing who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly different from <hi>God</hi> shee must notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing acknowledg <hi>God</hi> therin, or at least behold the same as a thing wholy <hi>Spirituall,</hi> and <hi>deuyne,</hi> which vndoubtedly requyres a strong, &amp; firme <hi>fayth,</hi> and confidence in <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="409" facs="tcp:104174:209"/>
               <p>In so much that it is impossible that any man remayn (as hath beene said) eleuated aboue the Multiplicity of Externall works, who is not before exercised in some reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable sort according to the precedent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in solitude, and sequestration; and hath not made some good progres in <hi>abnegation, Resignation, pure Loue, and naked fayth</hi> as formerly wee haue taught. For it is good reason that a Man learn first in sequestration from all Creatures to forget them, before Hee endeauour to forget them, they being actually present, and learn before in solitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de to separate his <hi>Spiritt</hi> from the senses, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee go about to do the same in multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of Externall works. And also by <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation</hi> of himself first seeke to fynd <hi>God</hi> in <hi>him,</hi> before Hee intend to fynd, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn <hi>God</hi> by <hi>Annihilation</hi> of Exterior Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Yea Hee in whom this interior dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position hath not gone before is not only vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to Exercise himself after this secret man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, But also cannot vnderstand that little which wee haue heere said of this Exercise of the Multiplicity. Whereas notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to One that is practised therin it is very cleare, though very hard in the beginning to performe it, so perfectly as hath beene said.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the impediments through which the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritt (who now after the foresaid Manner as well in symple works to the enioying of God, as in manifold which requyre par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular attention to the Actuall Vnion with God hath begunn to eleuate itself) is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred that it cannot persist in that Eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and of the Remedyes against Them.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BVT albeit the soule enioying <hi>God</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Doctryn heere taught her hath now begunn to fynd in herself this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ascension of the <hi>Spiritt,</hi> as well in sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as in multiplicious works, and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and hath now seene how a Man abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue all Multiplicity may in vnity of <hi>Spiritt</hi> Eleuate himself to the fruition of the secret <hi>presence of God,</hi> or at least to the actuall <hi>Vnion with God.</hi> Neuertheles shee must know that in the beginning shee will very easily fall from thence, loose all Vnity, and be in Multiplicity against her <hi>will.</hi> For thr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough the least impression, Commotion, trouble, or Operation to which shee yields, and giues place in her, or Conuerts herself vnto; shee presently leaues her <hi>nothing,</hi> is extrouerted, and breakes the <hi>intymme vnion</hi> which she had with <hi>God:</hi> which at the first, as well in the One Exercise, as in the Other,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:104174:210"/> will oftentymes happen. But most of all the soule extrouerts herself from <hi>God</hi> in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior employments which requyre an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall attention of the powrs, and senses; and looseth soonest of all in such like works the foresaid <hi>Vnity</hi> of her <hi>Spiritt,</hi> by reason shee is there more Conuerted to the exterior Things; and her Powres, and senses consist in more Operation; also being this Eleuation of the <hi>Spiritt</hi> aboue the manifold exterior works only consists in an internall auersion from all Creatures, and hath not an actuall conuersion to <hi>God,</hi> like as the other which in symple works enio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeth <hi>Gods secret presence.</hi> Hence it is also necessarily in vnexercised Men sooner lost y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> in the former Exercise although of its own nature it can stand, notwithstanding all imployments. Hence the faythfull soule meeting with these manifold difficultyes in the beginning must not wonder much the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reat, nor contristate herself; but must endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re them all patiently doing her vtermost en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour to ouercome the same by interior Constancy of <hi>Spiritt,</hi> and more stedfastnes in <hi>God.</hi> And to expres more in particular which be the impediments which do hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the soule of that which now shee hath obtayned, to wit, (the knowledg how to eleuate herself aboue the exterior work to <hi>God</hi>) that shee cannot perseuer there. They do sufficiently appeare out of that which
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:104174:211"/> hath beene already said, out of diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And first of all, when as the soule is troubled in her symple works in the enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>God,</hi> when it doth not happen by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son shee doth Contrary to the admonition wee heeretofore haue giuen her touching generally the Attention in tyme of the Exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior works; Then is it becaus shee yields place in her to some of the impediments which wee haue haue declared to her hee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retofore in the Exercise in tyme of quietnes, and sequestration. For being that in symple works the soule emoyeth <hi>God</hi> as in her Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or recollection hence the same impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are in the One haue also place in the other, and must be ouercome in both after the same manner. In so much that all the Images, Commotions, and troubles which shee either by incident Cogitations, or rebellion of her senses, feeles in herself whereby shee is mediated from <hi>God;</hi> how,<note place="margin">Passe, and pray.</note> or in what manner soeuer they be, shee must not ouercome Otherwise y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> by perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering in her symple Conuersion to <hi>God</hi> (as hath beene said) which is heere somewhat more troublesome vnto her, y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> in the other. Becaus shee doth not stand thus, through her own Intymme operation eleuated to <hi>God,</hi> but by meanes of that symple reflection vppon the Exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior work which in tyme of Commotion, and impugnation cannot be so symply per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:104174:211"/> by an vnexercised person. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles the soule may not do any thing else, neither may shee therefor turn herself frō the work to <hi>God,</hi> as shee doth in her quiet prayer in solitude. For thereby shee would procure a new impediment to herself; but shee must with all possible diligence conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in that symple exterior reflection, and resume the same agayn with all tranquillity how often-soeuer shee perceiues herself to be departed from thence. For there is no Other Remedy for her y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> this, and by this shee will in tyme be aboue all Multiplicity established in <hi>God,</hi> and also without hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance remayn in the externall work enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in case the soule in her work happen to loose <hi>God</hi> by reason shee is defectiue in some of the Admonitions heeretofore set down, to wit, becaus she fynds the work not to be absolutely necessary, although not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding shee begunn the same out of a good Intention, and as such: or that shee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue in herself a tediousnes of the work; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture seeking to quit itself thereof; or at least foundan another intention to arise in herself y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> that with which shee first accepted the work. Shee must for all that (if that shee cannot leaue of the work according to true <hi>discretion</hi>) vse <hi>nothing</hi> to the Contrary, But the foresaid symple Conuersion to <hi>God</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly perseuering in the same, as if the

And remayning so conuerted to <hi>God</hi> shee will wholy exclude that ariseing sinister in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and also perfectly expell that te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diousnes better y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> if shee should interiorly oppose herself agaynst them.

And that the soule may know whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her shee behaue herself, as shee ought ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ainst all occurring impediments, and that shee be not hindered by the same in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior enioying of <hi>God.</hi> Let her reflect vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the signes which wee haue giuen her before; whereby to know whither shee doth performe her <hi>interior Conuersion</hi> to <hi>God</hi> as shee ought.

So that the soule to enioy <hi>God</hi> in her symple works must be as loose, and vacant from that Exterior Obiect, and also from her own Image, as though they were actually annihilated, yea shee must stand also eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted aboue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And all these Documents (some few ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepred] haue also place in the symple Eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Spiritt.</hi> By which wee haue said that the soule in tyme of multiplicious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior works [which requyre particular at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention] must perseuer in the <hi>deuyne Vnion,</hi> for albeit shee do not actually there enioy <hi>God,</hi> neuertheles there must be the same dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the foule which is requyred to the actuall enioying of <hi>God</hi> excepting only that intymme Operation to <hi>God</hi> from wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ich shee remayns vacant: and therefor is not eleuated in herself aboue tyme, and place although shee be wholy auerted from them, [as hath beene said] so that all that hinders the soule there, and mediates from <hi>God,</hi> doth her heere the same harme. Except that the intymme operation by which shee there
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:104174:213"/> conuerts herself to <hi>God</hi> takes no place heere; &amp; consequently the relenting, and feeblenes of the <hi>Spiritt</hi> [through which the same is lost] doth properly heere do her no hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. In so much that when as she also is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriorly wholy relented, and grown Tepid: so that shee cannot eleuate herselfe in the height of the <hi>Spiritt</hi> to the <hi>secret presence of God,</hi> Neuertheles shee is able after this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent manner through the interior denuda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Vacancy to eleuate herself in the height of her <hi>Spiritt</hi> to the <hi>deuyne Vnion</hi> wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ich is only requisit to this present Exercise in Multiplicious Works.</p>
               <p>And When as the soule in herself is after such manner perfectly bared, and emptyed of all Propriety, and grosse naturall Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion [as before hath beene said] y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> is shee no further hindred but by her vnexercised<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, to wit: Becaus shee is not yet accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and sufficiently practised to work ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriory with this nakednes, and Vacancy, for y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> shee is easily disquieted by the senses, who in the presence of the Exterior Obiect conuert themselues to the same with their accustomed grosse Operatiuenes, whereby the soule is effigiated, obscured, and disquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in her <hi>internall Peace,</hi> and looseth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux of the <hi>deuyne light</hi> in Her.

For albeit this exercise exteriorly is Operatiue, neuertheles interiorly it is wholy passiue in respect of the <hi>deuyne light;</hi> and also of all impugnation, and striuing agaynst; yea, yet
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:104174:214"/> lesse, can the soule heere exteriorly vse any operation interior.

In so much that albeit the soule (as it will often happen in the beginning) when by the incident Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, cogitations, and ariseing Commotions she is wholy ouer whelmed, so that it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes vnto her, that there it neither <hi>God</hi> nor <hi>deuyne Light</hi> in the world: Neuertheles shee must performe that exterior work which shee hath to do, as symply, and quietly: as though shee felt, or perceiued no impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; without giuing any answere to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer either Exteriorly, or interiorly doth impugne her.

               <p>And as wee haue said in the precedent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise in <hi>quietnes, and abstraction:</hi> that when the soule fynds herself obscured, interiorly distracted, and wholy out of <hi>God</hi> shee must endure symply all occurring impediments, and adhering to her <hi>interior peace</hi> without vsing any resistance against those incident Images, and arising Commotions.

<pb n="421" facs="tcp:104174:215"/> easyly know this <hi>truth</hi> agayn, if shee symply with a perfect <hi>Interior Peace</hi> endeauour to performe that exterior work; whereby the Obscurity will be expelled out of her, and the <hi>deuyne light</hi> arrise agayn in Her.</p>
               <p>But lett vs heere giue the soule also a sign whereby shee may know whither shee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue in due perfection obtayned this <hi>deuyne Vnion</hi> (whereof wee haue spoken) aboue all exterior Multiplicity. For although it be as cleare, and certayn to a well practised soule (as to one that seeth wel, to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth whither the sunn be risen, or no) yet to a soule that is a beginner, it is wholy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certayn, and many deceaues themselues ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. For this <hi>Vnion</hi> is also indiuisible, so that it must be either whole, and perfect in vs, or not at all. Which Totality, and integrity is known to very few, and much lesse haue they it in them albeit they perhaps perswade themselues they haue. The soule therfor shall obserue whither shee in the midst of busy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes albeit shee be exteriorly busyed with her senses, be notwithstanding interiorly so naked, loose, and vacant; and stand in as great <hi>Annihilation,</hi> and <hi>Obliuion</hi> of herself, and be as little mediated by any Creature before <hi>God,</hi> as if shee were in the depth of her solitude, and stilnes. For so must shee be to remayn in the solitude of <hi>Spiritt,</hi> and in the vse of the <hi>deuyne Light</hi> [as doth suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently appeare by that which heeretofore
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:104174:216"/> hath beene said] and this she may easily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue being shee hath sometymes experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced this <hi>Interior disposition</hi> at leastwise in ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of her <hi>Interior Prayer</hi> made in <hi>solitude,</hi> &amp; <hi>Abstraction,</hi> to which comparing her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent state, and disposition shee may easyly obserue whither they agree together, or no. But the soule which hath sometymes truly experienced this Eleuation of <hi>Spiritt</hi> in her exterior workes, will also perceiue in herself sensible, and palpable signs when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer shee falls down from the Vnity of her <hi>Spiritt</hi> to the multiplicity of her senses, and powrs; if only shee keepe a Constant obseruing of her own experience to which wee remit her, rather y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> to set it heere down in particular least perhaps the vnexperien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced who little know the <hi>Interior disposition</hi> of the <hi>deiformed soule,</hi> hold it incredible. Let it therefore suffice her that wee haue admonished her heereof.</p>
               <p>Another sign is; whither the soule when shee leaues of those Exterior Imployments can presently without impediment conuert herself to the enioying of the <hi>deuyne presence</hi> in her; yea without altering of her disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion otherwise y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> to assume the <hi>intymme ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> by which shee must conuert herself to <hi>God.</hi> For the soule is thus disposed interior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which in her exterior working remaynes in the <hi>Vnion with God;</hi> as may easily appeare by what hath beene said. Yea also in tyme of
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:104174:216"/> the Exterior works shee is always able in an instant to Eleuate herself to the Actuall Contemplation of <hi>God;</hi> and that with as little Labour as to open her hand when it is shutt together; for the <hi>Spiritt</hi> that stands im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately vnder <hi>God</hi> eleuates, and opens it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self as easyly as a hand that is shutt, is ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; so that when the soule perceiues that shee must auert herself from some-thing, leaue, or resume some-thing when shee conuerts herself from her Exterior work to <hi>God,</hi> it is a sign that shee had not the <hi>deuyne Vnion</hi> in its Perfection. For when shee hath it y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> is shee also in the midst of her exterior imployments so separated from all Creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, and absorpt in <hi>God,</hi> that if shee were at<note place="margin">The true nothing</note> that very instant to dy shee could not sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate herself more from them nor leaue them more y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> shee actually doth. For shee hath the end, and Consummation of all Abne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and Resignation in her. Being now come to a perfect <hi>nothing,</hi> or annihilation of herself which ought to be wellnoted. Other signs there be; as whither this solitude wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ich the soule hath in her exterior works be not in the powrs, and affection; whither shee doth retayn it with any force, or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; or be there mixed with any tedious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, grief, vexation, or any other trouble, for all this is against this Vnion whereof wee haue spoken which is aboue the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and Powrs purely in the <hi>Spiritt,</hi> and
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:104174:217"/> without any Labour, and difficulty; yea without any operatiuenes (as hath beene said) is obtayned, and retayned, and expells all greif, sorrow, and trouble, both of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and soul placing Man in a perfect <hi>obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uion</hi> of Himself.</p>
               <p>These signs the soule must reflect vppon to know whither shee be truly <hi>vnited</hi> with <hi>God</hi> in tyme of her exterior works. Shee must not therfor think that albeit shee fynds herself in an <hi>internall Peace</hi> without being disturbed, or distracted in tyme of her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall works that shee therefor hath the <hi>deuyne Vnion.</hi> For many haue such like <hi>peace,</hi> but few the actuall <hi>Vnion with God,</hi> and the constant vse of the <hi>deuyne Light</hi> to which is requyred not only a good ordering of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and Passions, but also a perfect auersion from all that is created, and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Resignation of ones self in <hi>God,</hi> as hath beene said.</p>
               <p>And thus much concerning the impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which occurre in these two exercises of exterior works, as also the Remedyes ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aynst them which wee after such a grosse manner haue expressed; becaus the Interior disposition of the soule enioying <hi>God</hi> in her exterior works cannot be lesse properly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed then that of her Prayer in quietnes, and solitude. Neuertheles the deuout soule hauing these grosse instructions will expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience what is said much cleerer then wee
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:104174:217"/> can by words expresse vnto her, and will by <hi>Gods</hi> grace dayly perceiue more, and more <hi>Vnity,</hi> and stability of <hi>Spiritt</hi> in her in tyme of Exterior working, and (if shee perseuer faythfully) will at length come so farr that shee will not be able to performe any exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior work but in the foresaid <hi>Vnity</hi> of <hi>Spiritt</hi> and will with as great facility transfer her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from the <hi>fruition</hi> into the <hi>Vnion</hi> with <hi>God;</hi> and agayn eleuate herself from the <hi>Vnion</hi> into the <hi>fruition</hi> (according as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior works requyre) as shee can open, and shut her eyes, or turn them vpwards, and downewards. For as the eyes do of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues without any actuall Obseruation of the Man; so also the <hi>Spiritt</hi> (which is now established aboue all senses, and Powrs in this <hi>denyne Vnity</hi>] can as swiftly, as the twinkeling of an eye open itself to the <hi>frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God;</hi> and agayn when it is needfull gather itself wholy together, and cast it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into the <hi>deuyne Light,</hi> and by that rest without <hi>Medium</hi> in <hi>God</hi> without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection proceeding from the Powrs.</p>
               <p>And this is altogether requisit; for being the Obseruation of the vnderstanding takes there no place it would caus euery tyme a new impediment in case the soule were to do this interior change with forethinking, and actuall reflecting therevppon being it must be performed with great subtility, and swiftnes. And becaus the soule in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:104174:218"/> hath not yet this Agility of <hi>Spiritt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">with pure simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</note> being as yet not sufficiently separated from herself therefor shee is able to continue, but a very small tyme eleuated abouer her work in <hi>God:</hi> but falls down agayn presently into the operation of her Powrs, and senses. This soule therefor enioying <hi>God</hi> which is now come thus farr must endeauour by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, and faythfull practise to obtayn in this manner essentially in her this <hi>Eleuation</hi> of <hi>Spiritt</hi> that it may be so familiar vnto her that [as a certayn spirituall Teacher saith] she retayn <hi>God</hi> as constantly in her Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at all tymes, and places as though it were naturall vnto her to haue <hi>God</hi> always <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</hi> To which shee must fynally know that shee must cheifly attayn vnto by diligently obseruing of her Recollection, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questration; and in the same through the <hi>secret introuersion</hi> theeretofor spoken of] more fully, and perfectly sinking, and loos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herself in <hi>God</hi> whereby her <hi>Spiritt</hi> will be more, and more separated from the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and all Creatures, and more firmely established in <hi>God:</hi> and so made fit according to this last manner to remayn aboue all mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity thus simply eleuated in <hi>God;</hi> for this last Exercise in Multiplicity of works, is properly a fruict, and effect of the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent exercise in <hi>solitude,</hi> and <hi>Quietnes.</hi> And shee must therin as in her schoole be taught. For like as the soule is there eleuated aboue
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:104174:218"/> her senses, Powrs, and her whole being in a symplicity of <hi>Spiritt:</hi> so must shee after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by the same ouercome all Exterior Multiplicity; so that the soule must not stand so much vppon the last Instruction; as vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon her own Interior experience which must be the foundation whervppon shee must build all that now is said.</p>

               <p>BVT being wee haue heeretofore by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall similitudes declared vnto the sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le enioying <hi>God</hi> her way to <hi>God,</hi> and also all her internall exercises; so remayns it heere, yet for the last; that wee also by an externall similitude expres this symple <hi>Eleuation</hi> of the <hi>Spiritt</hi> by which wee haue said that shee must in Exterior busines remayn [where shee must with her Powrs, and senses work outwardly with reflection] in the <hi>deuyne Vnion</hi> without hinderance which is indeed the most hidden <hi>secret</hi> which wee haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared vnto her. And to performe the same wee will first reduce agayn before her the
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:104174:219"/> Comparison of a shipp sayling in the depth of the sea; for by that in the beginning ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Ability wee set before her eyes her interior disposition in respect of that wherein before shee was. Wherefor to stick to this Comparison [albeit wee haue heeretofor said] that the sequestration is yet more, and consequently that change greater betwixt the exercise of the soule in Exterior multiplicious works, and in her solitude; y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> is betwixt a sea voyage, and a iorney by land. Like as the soule in her quiet Prayer, &amp; sollitude is likened to a shipp which with stretched forth, and with full sayles sayleth through the midst of the sea towards the Hauen; becaus that in her quietnes, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude shee doth freely stretch forth, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late her <hi>Spiritt</hi> like vnto a sayle stretched forth vppon a Mast to receiue the wynd the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby to sayle speedily through the midst of the sea to the Hauen. For through the forth-stretched <hi>Spiritt</hi> shee receiues, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyes the <hi>deuyne</hi> influxe like vnto a prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Wynd by which shee makes a swift progres through all Creatures, and herself, and is by little, and little established in <hi>God</hi> [as hath beene said] so may wee compare a soule which by the foresaid <hi>Eleuation</hi> of the <hi>Spiritt</hi> in Exterior Multiplicity stands aboue all Creatures in Vnity, with a shipp which in the midst of the sea [being hindred by
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:104174:219"/> Tempest that it cannot sayle forward] lyes still at the Anchor. For like as shee hath all her sayles down, drawn in, and sayles not forward towards the Hauen being hindred by force of the Tempest, and yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les lyes fast in the sea by reason of her heauy anchor cast out, and is not carried away by the violence of the wynds. In like manner also the soule fynding herself in the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of Creatures, and her Hart within as a troubled sea by reason of her senses, Powrs, affections, and Passions which as tempestuous wynds, and stormes impugne the tranquillity of the Mynd, and peaceable enioying of <hi>God.</hi> In such manner as that the <hi>Spiritt</hi> cannot rayse itself to <hi>God,</hi> and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the <hi>deuyne</hi> influx sayl forward, and be wholy absorpt in <hi>Him.</hi> The soule I say perceiuing this drawes vp the sayl of her <hi>spiritt</hi> which stood spread forth, and wholy extended in <hi>God,</hi> and in a moment collects the same, and draweth it vp together euen to a little spark, casts it into the depth of the <hi>deuyne vnity</hi> aboue all Multiplicity of Exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Things, and operations of her senses, and powrs through which shee lyest fast at Anchor in the denudation, and Vacancy ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aynst all ariseing thoughts, and other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, as though shee were not at all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned. But although she shipp that lyeth thus at Anchor reapes that Benefit thereby that shee doth not go backwards, yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynly
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:104174:220"/> shee looseth tyme in not pursuing her intended course. It is notwithstanding other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise with the soule which Lyeth thus fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which doth not therfor loose any tyme. For being thus eleuated in solitude, and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>spiritt,</hi> albeit shee is not capable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the influence of the <hi>deuyne presence:</hi> neuertheles shee gayns continually ground of her senses, and powrs which are heereby more, and more bared, and vnwrought, &amp; subiected to the <hi>spiritt,</hi> the soule also is more strengthned in the knowledg, and Loue of <hi>God,</hi> keeping herself thus recollected in this actuall <hi>Vnion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to explicate the manner after which the <hi>spiritt</hi> consisting in this Eleuation doth behold all exterior multiplicious things out of it in Vnity: wee will vse the similitude of our exterior sight, and the <hi>Light</hi> of the sunn obserue therefor that wee can behold the visible obiects either as they are in themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues without taking any Notice, or reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vppon the <hi>Light</hi> of the sunn wherin they are, and wherewith wee behold them, or else as they be exteriorly by that <hi>Light</hi> shyned vppon, and vnited therewith. The first manner of beholding is with more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention force, and fixednes of our visible powr vppon the Exterior things. For it is wholy conuerted therevnto; and fixed the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revppon. But the other is done loosely, and vacantly; for to that there is no force re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyred;
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:104174:220"/> yea all force, and Violence would hinder in this kynd of sight. Hence it is that wee can also behold many things together as a whole orchard of trees vppon which she sunn shynes; or a chamber full of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; which wee cannot so do when wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold any thing fixedly in itself. For the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble powr is then wholy conuerted rhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto.</p>
               <p>Now to our purpose when as the soule with that <hi>deuyne Light</hi> beholds the Exterior Things in symplicity of <hi>Spiritt,</hi> shee is like one who after the foresaid second manner beholds Things as shyned vppon by the <hi>light,</hi> and Exteriorly vnited with the same, and therefor shee conuerts herself thervnto very loosely, and vacantly without force, or Violence remayning always in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior denudation, and vacancy, and shee is also able to behold, to heare, to do many things together. And in the meane tyme to remayn in symplicity, and Vnity of Mynd. For albeit the Obiects be manifold; the soule neuertheles takes them all as one, being all but one in that symple <hi>Light.</hi> Yet this <hi>Light</hi> is not vppon those Exterior Things which shee beholdeth but only in her, and shee by that conuerts herself to those things out of her, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And to giue also to vnderstand by this Comparison of the <hi>exterior Light,</hi> How this Exercise of the soule is in itself in respect of the other in quietnes, and solitude; and the <hi>Vnion</hi> with <hi>God</hi> Compared to the <hi>frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and enioying of the <hi>deuyne presence.</hi> It is to be noted that the <hi>Spiritt</hi> in quietnes, and solitude, as also in symple Exterior works enioying of <hi>God;</hi> is like vnto one who hath his whole sight conuerted to the Globe of the sunn cleerely shyning in the firmament (suppose it were possible) such an one would there perfectly behold, and enioy that cleare <hi>Light</hi> in its Origin, and (if so be his eyes could thereby be within more enlightned) would receiue from then<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce a great clearnes in his eyes. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the <hi>Spiritt</hi> when it enioyeth the <hi>deuyne presence</hi> after the foresaid manner, it is who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly introuerted to that increated <hi>Light</hi> which is the origin of all other <hi>Light;</hi> from when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce immediately doth proceede that noble <hi>Light</hi> which it perceiues, and Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes in the innermost of the soule enioying the same in its fountayn Clarity [for as much as wee are capable of it in this life] And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus it is capable thereof it is thereby inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally enlightned.</p>
               <p>And when as it thus beholdeth exteriorly
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:104174:221"/> the Creatures in that <hi>deuyne light,</hi> y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> is it li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke vnto the foresaid Man who afterwards withdrawing his eyes from the cleare shyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sunn should behold below vppon the Earth how the beames thence flowing do spread themselues through the vniuersall world shyning vpon, and illuminating all things heere below: by which sight hee would also be more confirmed in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the sunn, beholding how wide, and broad it powreth forth its Beames, and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uld also reckon himself to be in the presence of the sunn as-long as hee perceiued himself to be shyned vpon by the Beames, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds the <hi>Light</hi> thereof; albeit hee did not actually conuert his sight to the sunn itself. In like manner this illuminated soule, when as now comming out of her solitude from the Contemplation of the <hi>deuyne presence</hi> shee must extrouert herself, and apply her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to exterior necessary Busines: y<seg rend="sup">n</seg> shee seeth how that all Creatures depend of the increated sunn, and of the <hi>deuyne essence,</hi> as of their <hi>origin</hi> from whence they proceed; by which sight shee is also corroborated in the knowledg of <hi>God,</hi> and holds herself to be in his <hi>presence</hi> [albeit shee do not actually contemplate <hi>Him</hi>] becaus shee fynds her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be in that <hi>heauenly light</hi> which shee full well knoweth to proceed from <hi>him.</hi> And becaus shee also knoweth that as-long as shee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>By this, and the precedent comparisons, and instructions the deuout soule may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue how shee is to apply, and behaue her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self interiorly to fynd <hi>God</hi> truly, and hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found <hi>Him</hi> to retayn <hi>him</hi> certaynly without euer separating herself from the <hi>Vnion</hi> with <hi>Him</hi> which knowledg will not a liltle help her if shee haue in her the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration expressed in the fowr Poynts, wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ich be the foundation vppon which this whole Doctryn is built; for hauing that, shee may make great profit by this Doctryn heere set down, and very easyly obtayn [ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it may be obtayned in this life] the <hi>frnition</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> if so be shee do fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and constantly exercise herself heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
